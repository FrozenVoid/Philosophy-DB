Love as it appears energetically
 is a cord between two chakras:
usually heart attaches
to another heart chakra(though
 it depends on person).
 
 Problems:
 
A.Love monopolizes heart chakra
 energies(astral energy e.g. kindness, affection,
 nurture) towards a single cord
 to another entity, which can
 also close the cord exit(thus
 making the lover an energy donor
 for energy absorber).
 Lower and lower energy in
 Air element, increases Water element
  which downshifts energy profile
  towards material realm:
 (i.e. without mutual heart chakra
 energy exhange).
 
B.Love vs loving-kindness(Buddhism):
Basics:
Love is inherently a selfish emotion
(despite the appearance) with 
a singular focus towards a specific
entity which generate a tulpa 
attached to the cord linking the
host and target of love.
The host state is shaped by
the concept of 'ideal love'(i.e. idealized, unreachable
 state of love: perfect lovers) 
which is tulpa of heart chakra
 cord,that host assigns positive
 qualities to imagined ideal 
 target of Heart-cord,feeding the
 tulpa ego-power and becoming
 subservient to tulpa: the imagined
 'ideal lower' is produced by
mind as the heart cord tulpa.

Loving-kindsness: unlike love
loving kindness does not:
1.Create cords: by not attaching
to specific entities the kindness
is shared externally as a field,
not a cord.
2.Does not monopolize heart chakra
 energy, as it elevate the base
 state of chakra towards more 
 positive external energy flow:
 loving-kindness internally uses
heart channels in non-exclusive 
 way - growth is not dependent on
  cords, connections or emotions,
as loving-kindness permeates the
 heart chakra structure(i.e.
 non-cord, non-specific,
 field-generating emotion) and
 balances the astral aura field,
 which in state of love creates
 a strong polarization between
 loved/hated categories that 
 increase aversion/hate/discrimination
  due refinement of Air element
  energy focused on single subject:
  Air amplifies emotional constrast
  and color of emotion, which in this
  case assigns most positive values
  to target of heart chakra cords and
   decreasingly positive to negative values
   to entities further from the cord.
  
 C.Heart chakra corruption:
 Love as in existence of inter-heart
  cords, justifies many forms
  of corruptions and crime that
 occur because the host desires
  preserving/strengthening 
 the cord(s) as Air elements 
 monopolizations deprives other
 chakras of the energy balance,
 allowing unrefined, crude mental
 constructs and 'heartless' actions
 to actualize under an energy deficit,
 as heart cords are often one-sides
  without mutual love.
  
 D. Possession risk:
 The attachment of heart chakra
 cords to an entity can occur
 without a real target,
 to an mental plane form(e.g. 
 waifus), creating heart cord 
 tulpa 'out of thin air', which
in turn allows entities to attach
 into the heard-cord exit point
 manipulating the tulpa and 
 taking possession of host.
