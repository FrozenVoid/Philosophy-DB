Despite feeling like a polar opposite
the emotion of Hate is close
energetically to 'negative Love'
which as expected creates a heart
 chakra cord towards the target
 of hate.

Abstract hate:
Hating abstract concepts/general
ideas/forms creates an open-ended
 heart chakra cord that other
 entities can attach to,
 tulpa of 'ideal hate object',
 similar to tulpa of 'ideal lover'
will form with prolonged feeding
of hate and corrupt the host aura
with its own emanations('hate aura')


Cord energy change:
As with all cords, the type
of energy in the cord can change
from hate to love, dependent
on host's mind, which would usually
be used(subconsciously) to disattach cords to
objects of love, as most targets
are aversive to 'negative Love' 
energy(except energy vampires and
 astral/mental parasites).
However as the cord disconnects
other entities can exploit the
exit end of heart cord to influence
the host, often grafting a new
tulpa fed by hate for 'past Love/Hate'.

Hate and Love:
Both of these emotions are Air
 element being forced into 
 an extreme  configuration where
 heart is polarized between 
 dualistic energy fields:
 extreme hate proportionally
 create a polarization allowing
 extreme love, and vice versa,
