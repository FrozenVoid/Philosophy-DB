 Narcissism(self-tulpa love) is
 particularly potent source of
 heart polarization as energy 
 circuits of narcissists are 
 heart cords looped around one's 
 chakras(e.g. heart to own heart,
 heart to manipura), creating
 a heavy burden to any external
  energy flow as narcissists
 become a blackhole of astral
 energy(i.e. energy vampires).
