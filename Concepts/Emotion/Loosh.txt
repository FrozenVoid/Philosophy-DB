Loosh is packets of Astral/Etheric
 energy emitted by heart/throat
 chakra during extreme emotional
events and 'emotional outbursts'.
This energy is powerful enough
to create accidental tulpa/servitors
and itself presents attractive
feeding source for high-level 
astral predators/parasites who
will promote its production:
Egregores, Archons, Flyers, Tulpas all
benefit from absorbing this
'vata energy' as their constitution
is 'vata humor'.

Control of emotion:
Emotion is energy currency in
higher level planes - with more
refined emotions appealing to 
higher-level entities consuming
them(as humans eat plants/animals).
By reducing emotional output 
a major energy restructuring in
the human aura occurs that makes
one 'unappealing' to these entities
(e.g. flyers), however plain
'emotion supression' will leak this energy
eventually - the goal is to reduce
baseline emotional output to minimal
 acceptable level and use it internally.

Humans are in effect refining
base material energy(heavy kapha,
earth) into refined vata(astral/etheric)
as process of life naturally produces
 biological pathways of refinement 
 in subtle bodies: this process is
however artificially kept at level
of heart chakra by astral parasites/predators
who absorb emotional Air element 
energy and leeach high-Etheric output
of throat chakra to supress human will.
