Emulation is a category of behavior where a person
pretends to be another personality, often constructed
by copying role models or artificial ideals.

Types:
1. Roleplaying: a person tries to conform to 
a vague role category by adopting features/traits/manners,
usually expected of such role.
A role can be constructed as 'ideal X' that person
tries to fulfill to the best of his ability.

2.Imposition: a temporary/situational role constructed
by adopting a tulpa-type personality which is 
more fitted to handle a specific event or situation.

3.Public image emulation: a person tries to 
fulfill social expectations and obligations that
come from the past behavior and reputation established.

4.Character emulation: usually used for humor or
satire, where a person pretends to be a target of
comedy or drama, constructed by emulating behavior
of 'original character' that is fitted as imagined role:
e.g. a jester-type character would pretend to be
another to provide comedic effect.
