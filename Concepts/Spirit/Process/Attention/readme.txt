The process of 'paying attention' is an
active energy exchange from the perceiver to
the subject: merely something passive as
'noticing' is two-way energy exchange,
equivalent to light-weight tulpa-forcing of
'expected content'(predicted by expectation and
comparison) where attention is used to build 
future status-quo 'expectation object' that is
focused on: the object energy is 'tuned in' and
absorbed and the subject is imagined as 'observation
 focus point' that grants it influence(e.g. fear)
 as if the object was broadcast into the mind.
