An innate quality of a spirit
that doesn't correspond to power/size
or amount of knowledge it has, but 
refinement level of its senses:
e.g. purity of perception,moral sense,
discernment of emotion/lucidity of thought,
self-consciousness and understanding of self.


Purity of spirit reflects in its color
and light, with darker colors representing
a lower purity(unclean spirits) state,
with lowest purity spirits 
giving off black light
(color of aura).
  
Spiritual purity doesn't translate
 exactly into good/evil dichotomy,
 but represents the plane that
 the spirits can access:
Pure spirits with 'evil intent' 
can exist - their actions can impact
their own purity making them
descend in planar hierarchy.

Spiritual purity is harmed by
 corruption of the soul, but souls
 are not components of spirits,
 just a bound entity: soulless
  spirits can have purity but
cannot refine themself
further without a soul's energy.
