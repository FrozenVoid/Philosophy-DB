Etheric body replacement is 
a product of intense takeover when
a person's etheric body is shifted
out as another entity is brought in.
and attaches to existing chakra lines.


Symptoms:
1.Astral projection is impossible,
limited dream control.
It would feel out of place
during twilight stage of sleep
or astral projection, as foreign
nature of entity will clash with
host astral body, producing
the characteristic "dual body"
feeling which prevents astral
projection and heavily restricts
control in dreams(lucidity and
movement).

2.Movement of hands dissociated
from mental control: any suspicious
 involuntary movement.
3.Feeling of internal movement in
 muscles, bones or tissues.
4.Seeing side rainbow shimmer on moving head
 when under trance or intense focus/stillness.
5.Intense Crown Chakra activity:
feeling of loss of control over
crown area, invisible on-head movement:
crown chakra parasites infestation,
flyers, etc are present in force.
6.Unexplainable mood shifts and
constant emotional drain/discomfort.
7.Aversion to specific foods or
 colors that appears suddenly.
8.Intense reaction to sounds,
etheric body vibration on hearing
anything loud.
9.Repeated thoughts that copy
recent memory or sense data:
instinctual repetition or 
obsessive focus on single idea that
one "does not wish to think of",
but evoke strong emotional reaction.
