A plane that is built to reform spirits
 increasing their qualities and 
 purging their mindstreams of wrong beliefs
 (belief incompatible with life on the plane).
 
 Normally a spirit will have
  no incentive to improve as 
 their form is constant and immutable
 spiritual energy, but given
 a soul and bound to a plane their 
 spiritual mindstream is forced
 to evolve with their soul.
  Transitory planes serve as
 'evolution chambers' to refine subtle
 qualities of the spirit that it
 normally can't perceive:
 the emotions/thoughts/spiritual
  states of the [bound] plane imprint
a change in the spirit's internal
energy, modifying and evolving it:
an analogue to watching an anti-war
 film mutiple times, creates
 an innate aversion to war.
 
Material plane could be considered
a transitory plane for lower purity spirits
that lack perspectives of
social life and empathy, and cannot 
 be let into higher planes without 
 expirience and reform in their internal state.
