Imagine your body as a ship,
your soul as the collective crew(astral/mental/causal/etheric bodies,
chakra minds, guardian angels),
astral/mental parasites as 
 polyps and sea-beasts intruding
 on the ship, and yourself
 as neutral VIP passenger 
 worried about the ship sinking(death)
 or being taken over by pirates
 (demonic possession).
 
In this scenario the VIP passenger
can instruct the captain(mind,
mental body) but not act on his
own as he is unqualified to 
act independently, only observe
and advice the captain.
(In more closer analogy the 
VIP passenger off-loads the
'thinking' job to crew members
(e.g. navigators, radists,etc )
which then advice the captain
of desired route changes, as
interpreted from the VIP passenger
 preferences)


This analogy is very productive
starting point for introspective
analysis, despite its numerous 
flaws.

Tulpas:
Imagine tulpas as hired sailors,
rowdy, obnoxious and unculured that
have to 'adapt to the ship',
taking some responsibilities 
of the crew(soul), but effectively
 acting as second crew that can
 betray the captain(mind) and 
take over the ship - the control
of the crew effectively orhestrated
from whichever the VIP passenger
allows rule on the ship and 
how much value tulpas provide
vs the ship original crew.


Dreams and Projections:
The VIP passenger can depart the
ship in a smaller boat,ship's submarine or a 
plain lifeboat with reduced crew to
expirience undersea life, land on islands
or engage in diving tourism.

Death:
The ship sinks or rots away,
while passngers and crew depart
for nearest land in lifeboats,
rafts and whatever transport 
was at hand.

Possession:
The ship is taken over by 
pirates, with VIP passenger
imprisoned in his cabin and
unable to advice crew, which
 fights or submits to pirate
 ship. A daring rescue mission
 (spiritual help) frees the VIP
 passenger and kills the pirates
allowing to re-establish control
and repair the ship from combat.

Love and Hate:
Two ships exchange messages by
 radio, with some hateful and
 some supportive, radists may
 be given more privileges and
 attention by captain and VIP  passenger as
 relationship develops until
  the ships come together in
  combat or dock at same place
  to exchange goods.


Virtual reality,escapism, videogames,arts and hobbies:
Often the passenger is 
not focused about the ship
course and maintaince 
and goes to stay in his cabin,
tinkering and toying around,
 getting into a water pool
on the ship, wasting his time
in cafeteria or just looking at
birds around: the passenger thinks it a all about his 
leisure at the cruise, while
ignoring the crew around as simple servants. The ship goes
on with the captain's control
and some crew assist the passenger in his leisure 
activities. The passenger eventually gets back to the 
reality of being at sea and talks with 
the captain to find out the 
current situation and weather:
the realization of dependence on
crew(subtle bodies, chakras, mindstreams,emotional complexity,mental health), ship state(body health) and the sea conditions(life circumstances) often cause the passenger to retreat back to simpler cabin life and ignore(escapism) the world at large.
