Imagine your body as a ship,
your soul as the collective crew(astral/mental/causal/etheric bodies,
chakra minds, guardian angels),
astral/mental parasites as 
 polyps and sea-beasts intruding
 on the ship, and yourself
 as neutral VIP passenger 
 worried about the ship sinking(death)
 or being taken over by pirates
 (demonic possession).
 
In this scenario the VIP passenger
can instruct the captain(mind,
mental body) but not act on his
own as he is unqualified to 
act independently, only observe
and advice the captain.
(In more closer analogy the 
VIP passenger off-loads the
'thinking' job to crew members
(e.g. navigators, radists,etc )
which then advice the captain
of desired route changes, as
interpreted from the VIP passenger
 preferences)


This analogy is very productive
starting point for introspective
analysis, despite its numerous 
flaws.

Tulpas:
Imagine tulpas as hired sailors,
rowdy, obnoxious and unculured that
have to 'adapt to the ship',
taking some responsibilities 
of the crew(soul), but effectively
 acting as second crew that can
 betray the captain(mind) and 
take over the ship - the control
of the crew effectively orhestrated
from whichever the VIP passenger
allows rule on the ship and 
how much value tulpas provide
vs the ship original crew.
