Ascension is transformation
of spirit's subtle(soul) and material
bodies(physical/vital body) to
a higher grade/planar
alignment,like an upgrade of 
spirit's clothes.

Ascension is not always visible
 as it can be a gradual process
 involving vast spiritual effort
 or prolonged influence of external
 powers/circumstances driving
 spiritual evolution.


Ascension is constrasted with
various death rituals like
Rainbow body production,
where body is entirely converted
 to another form and pop culture
 concept of Ascension that more closely
 resembles Apotheosis(
 conversion of human to god) or
 physical travel to heaven(
 see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entering_heaven_alive ).

Ascension does not imply 
projection to a higher realm
or entering it,
 but an internal transformation
 that is spiritually aligned
 with that realm - allowing more
 access to that in future projections
 and dreams, i.e. compatibility
 upgrade with higher realms,
 not a spectacle of body becoming
 a sparkling lightshow blowing
 of megawatts of energy
  which is pop culture image of
 ascension as process:
 the depicted above is apotheosis.

Ascension is associated with
gaining new powers and deeper
 senses, expansion of awareness
 and quality of mindstream.
