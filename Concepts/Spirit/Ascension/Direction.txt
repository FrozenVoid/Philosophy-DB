Ascension can proceed from
alignment to higher realm to
lower realm, with various effects
 to the body: the chakra system
 is realigned towards the dominant
 plane and realm.
 
Descent or ascent?
Elemental ranking or spiritual hierarchy
is not always linear or predictable,
and depends on exact realm on
the plane being ascended towards
as 'spiritual home',e.g.
ascent to plane A 6th layer might
be more beneficial than staying
at B's 2th layer, despire A being
below B in rank.

Specific realms/planes may
have closer links with material,
making ascent "down" seem like an
upgrade in energy/power, though
spiritually inferior in principle:
compatibility with existence on
material plane is major factor
limiting "upward" ascension, thus
making 'side'/'downward' ascent
more appealing.
