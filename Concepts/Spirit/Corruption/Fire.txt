Fire(plasma) is a natural source
of elemental energy, which humans usually
don't come in close contact with:
typically the body is placed near
 heat sources(this is more beneficial
  to reptiles, as humans generate 
  own heat(Fire/Manipura chakra))
  for comfort and cold prevention.
  
 
Fire disrupts Earth/Water composition
of physical body:
the Etheric body is expanded while
 Earth(flesh/matter) is contracted.
The initial warmth and etheric energy
is felt positively, however 

 The chronic effect is corruption
 through Air(fed by fire) drying
 out the Water+Fire drying Earth:
 this result in inflammation as
 the proportion of elements
  goes into disbalance:ether
   overflow results.
The expanded Etheric and Astral
body without stabilization of Kapha
 stripped by overheating will
 attract astral parasites 
 as they overflow with Fire-supplied
 energy.
