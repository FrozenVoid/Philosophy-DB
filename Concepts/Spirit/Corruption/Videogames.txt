Video games with few exceptions
are mental projection aids,
that transport the mind into
a constructed reality(CR):

1. This CR has patterns that
 translate to specific mental
  circuits(e.g. see enemy, jump on it).

2. The player, in order to be
proficient in the game has to learn
these circuits.

3. CR embeds itself into player's
 mind via mental projection:
 suspension of disbelief and
 transference of locus of control(
 player to player-avatar)

4.CR Avatar is actually a Tulpa(
player's 'personal demon'),
which gains energy from player
 focusing on it and spending
 time with it(or similar avatars
 which it can feed off).
It is created with astral and mental
 energy during moments intense focus
in game where player dissociates
from reality(Temporary Dissociation)
and imagines his avatar in-game
(even in 2D videogames) as
 center of existence:
 this center grows to a Tulpa,
 which absorbs emotional energy
 often demonic/negative types
 forced by violent/traumatic in-game interactions
 
5.Gaming 'addiction' is actually
 Tulpa gaining more control over
 its host and demanding investment
 in avatar-building activity:
It will leech effectively when
player is concentrated on single
 form(e.g. RPG character)
 played on continuous basis.
 
Where is spiritual corruption?
A. Player soul's mental body
is corrupted/subverted by tulpa
which changes soul's aura/energy
patterns that affect the player's
 spirit by its connection:
 Mental body connection 
 allows videogame world to 
 dictate 'space of thought' shaping
 fantasies, imagination and
 moral judgement by linking the 
 videogame world(via tulpa)
 as mental home of host(mentally
 shaped by its own tulpa).
 
B. Videogames offer a space
for dissociated meditation(also
similar to 'Scrying mirrors' in its persistent
focus on one object
that offers instant feedback).
This is a spiritual practice in
 a corrupted shape of material
focused videogame world, where
player imposes on himself additional
 material tasks instead of spiritual
 growth, mentally shaping own
 existence(tulpa) that steals attention
 and presence from physical living.
This 'spiritual transformation'
into a videogame-tulpa-host is the corruption
in its basic sense.

C.Abstractification and Tulpa-thinking:
Player simplifies in-game actions
that have real-world analogues(like
 killing) and later references
 them mentally to link with his
 tulpa(which is shaped by videogame laws)
when a real-world action occurs,
making it mentally comfortable
to dissociate from real-world patterns
 of behavior in favor of those learned
 in videogames: this doesn't remove
 morality but subverts the player via
  tulpa to simplify mental-emotional
  circuits into abstract mechanical action
  with rigid consequences/effects:
  player begins to treat the world
  with the mental capacity of his
   tulpa avatar, that allows one to
   outsource the impact on
   vulnerable emotional persona
   of Self via dissociative thinking
   (imposing videogame world) to
   a hybrid mental construct of
   tulpa-host that tulpa defines:
  similar to multiple personality
  disorder but in more subtle way,
  the tulpa begins to dictate 
  the host-player the terms of
  his mental world as its own:
Instead of own thinking the player
 speaks mentally through his tulpa.
