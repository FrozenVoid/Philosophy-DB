Magnetic fields and induced electromagnetic
 flows, will interfere with
 our subtle bodies and their 
position in Earth's magnetic field.
Etheric body will be directly harmed,


Harm can be caused by:
1.Wearing magnets or touching them,
draining etheric field.
2.Working near electric motors
and equipment generating
 alternating magnetic fields.
3.Electric wires with alternating current.
3A.Powerlines with alternating
current will affect large area nearby,
4.Plasma sources that generate strong 
magnetic fields.
5.Large static discharges such
as lightning strikes nearby,
electric shocks,etc
