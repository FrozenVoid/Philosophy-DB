Like 'cold iron to fairies' our
subtle bodies are vulnerable
to metals: heavy metals
and denser elements(lead,mercury) will drain our
 energy will lighter metals(aluminum)
 will scatter it. This damage
 will be constantly felt by spirit through the soul,
 which will alter the spirit's energy field..
 

Some metals have a beneficial effect
(usually for spiritual defense against intrusion):
e.g. silver and zinc, though they too drain energy.

Food which contain substantial
 amount of metal, especially in grosser
 froms such as supplemental iron,
will be harmful to chakras near
 stomach area and as metal particles
 spread they will lodge in chakras and channels
 places aligned with the etheric body.
   
Proximity to metals will also
 harm subtle bodies through 
 draining of aura/ether, though
  not as much as ingestion.
