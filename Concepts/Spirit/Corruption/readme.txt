Important question:
1. How do immaterial spirits are
corrupted by material world?
Corruption is transmitted up
via physical->subtle body->soul->spirit
(unless the spirit is in derealization/projection  state)

2.What is the source of corruption?
Any material activity has potential
to corrupt, with various degrees of effect,
e.g. breathing wrong(which is connected with pranayama )


3.What makes spirit choose corruption?
Spirits are more like directors
or passive observers with the 
soul(collective of subtle body bound
to specific plane) choosing the path.
Circumstances, emotions and bad judgement skills
 are at core of most decisions.
