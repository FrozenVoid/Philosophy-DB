While education system has some
 benefits to increasing the student 
 scope of knowledge(that in principle
 doesn't require education to understand)
 it also harms the soul through numerous 
 methods of education:
 1. Forced socialization groups:
 energy patterns of students
 are often incompatible and their subtle bodies
 will be allergic/hostile to forced integration.
 
 2. Repetitive memorization:
 this harms the mental body and creates aversion to forming
 memories and learning tiself.
 
 3.Astral amplification:
 as students are aligned to one cardinal direction,
 all their astral bodies
 will magnify elemental flow to that direction,
 creating an effect similar but entirely
 different in scope to mass prayer,
 will will charge the room with
 extreme levels of free astral energy
 that is bait to astral parasites.
 
 4. Sleep disruption:
 By not sleeping in the morning 
 the hypnotic state of
  Early Kapha period is prolonged.
This increases infflamation and stress
 on etheric body, that is essentially 
 forced to be awake:
the Early morning waking stunts
growth and wastes
 vast spiritual potential of 
 morning meditation(esp. for older students).
This method of sleep denial is also common to
many cults that want hypnotic obedience of 
late Vata-early Kapha trance state
