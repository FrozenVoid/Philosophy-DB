A zone with inter-planar transitions,
portals or gateways. The danger of corrupting
entities and parasitic attachments grows
with activity and presence of energy sources.

Roads, Crossings, Bridges and Gates are primary
examples for transitional states:
A.They contain streams of human etheric trails.
B.High-level energy emanations from constant
attention and focused effort.
C.Focused in limited, transition space or vehicles, moving in predictable, linear flow.


Locations where death occurs are weakened
to astral intrusion and etheric portals.
Vehicles as concept, especially with random
passengers are mobile cells moving through
transition zone(e.g. elevators/roads/lines)
