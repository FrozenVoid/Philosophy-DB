Plains are mix of Earth and Air 
element in their energetic composition
allowing a range of spiritual 
influences from Desert-like to
 grounded Earth energy centers,
 dependent on climate(humidity
 and winds).

Corruption: chronic Earth element 
grounding will deplete Fire
allowing spiritual intrusion
by stronger entities.
