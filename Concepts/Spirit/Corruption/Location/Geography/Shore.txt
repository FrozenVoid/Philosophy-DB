A shore(riverbanks,beach,lakefront)
energy state is the 
 Kapha(water/earth) environment
that corresponds to material plane
energy and supports balanced 
spiritual development as water
is subdued by earth(distance from
water body), allowing a range of
risks vs benefits for spirits
inhabiting the space.

Near shore: problems with
vata drain and similar effects
to water isolated places will
occur when living near water.
