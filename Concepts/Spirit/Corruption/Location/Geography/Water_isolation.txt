A location that is surrounded
by water, will have the following
effects:

1.Reduction in vata, draining
astral and etheric energy.
Water is element opposed to
air, creating Air deficit(
which however reduces influence
of astral entities and parasites)

2.Transmission of water qualities
to soul, as water imprints and
impurities will seep into 
elemental structure of sacral chakra.

3.General increase in sex drive:
sacral chakra is highly energized
and root chakra (by kapha) will
receive constant energy flows.

4.Spiritual corruption due
the previous factor influencing
average human population of 
 water isolated region and their
 combined energy shaping egregores
 and tulpa linked to lower chakras,
 energized by water overabudance.
 
 
What are water isolated locations:
1.Swampland
2.Islands(close to shore)
3.River deltas
4.Ships and platforms at sea
5.Places with artificial water
streams surrounding the location.
6.Underwater 

How are astral/etheric entities
are affected?
Flowing water, esp. saltwater 
deters most weaker astral entities 
as they will be drained of 
their primary subtle bodies 
energy, however entities 
attached to living beings will
 compensate with the host energies.
