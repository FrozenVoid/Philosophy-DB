Astral-etheric entities feel
at home in deserts as these
locations provide extreme vata
conditions.
1. Fire(sun, heat) raising
ambient energy in etheric matrix
of place.
2. Lack of water, which could 
drain their energy.
3. Dry and Hot(vata/pitta)
weather most of time.

Corruption:
Demonic possesion and spiritual
intrusion risks within deserts
are increased due abudance 
of such vata entities, however
spiritual development and 
refinement of soul are also 
amplified due same conditions
also helpful due astral/etheric
energy unopposed by water.
