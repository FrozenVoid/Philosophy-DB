North-west cardinal direction
for magnetic field, combines
 alements of Air and Earth,
 which allows one of most direct
 circuits to Astral plane from
 any cardinal direction(except North).

Sleeping with head in direction
of North-west
without any protection will
bring one in contact with astral
 entities before sleep phase
 where protection of astral
 body engage(i.e. twilight phase)
where etheric body is asleep,
but astral body is not yet 'projected',
this is likely due Earth element
kapha influence that delays projection
phase of sleep and reduces
 astral body energy(Earth grounding again).

The grand effect is that sleep
or merely trying to sleep in NW,
bring one to Astral(Air) without
 sensing any astral entities,
 that is dangerous outside 
 esoteric practices and deliberat
  rituals/projections.
  
Effects:
Nightmares, astral parasites intrusion,
lack of will in dreams, astral body
 damage in some case(vata overload
  combines with weakened state
  due Earth cardinal(westward))
  
Corruption:
NW direction for most people will
 create a state of 'vata overload'
 where strong astral-etheric 
 energies dominate:
 However as above the state
 of vata is incompatible
 with Kapha(Earth/Water) which
 corrupts vata, ensuing
  that 'vata overload' isn't mere
  energy peak but a corrupted peak
  of debased Air energy,which
  the astral body will have to endure,
 that will generate emotiona-astral
  flows sufficient to become
  a beacon for parasites in astral plane.

However NW direction will often be
instinctively rejected by most people
after a few dreams in that direction
or NNW/WNW
