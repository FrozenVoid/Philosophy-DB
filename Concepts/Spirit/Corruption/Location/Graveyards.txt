Graveyard is energetically
a place of planar transition
 where death energy and breakdown
 of soul creates strong imprints
 on the surrounding physical-etheric
 matrix, by proximity to dead bodies.

Graveyards are a 
gathering of former dead, demons
and shades/ghost/etheric shells
 eager to attach and leech energy
 of nearby spirits.


Bound entities: dead will produce
 etheric and astral shells,
 their soul can stay near the 
 grave location, various processess
 of soul breakdown may add ghosts/shades
  that will haunt the place 
  of death.
