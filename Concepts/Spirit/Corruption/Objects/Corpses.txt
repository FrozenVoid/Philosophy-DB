Corpses are an energy center where
 etheric/astral parasites concentrate
 while etheric body of former host
decomposes and dissolves in ether.
The primary danger is weakened
 emotional-astral state of people
 near the corpse which allow
 stronger parasites to latch on,
especially during rituals like
funerals where former corpse host
etheric body has energy cords
connected with nearby
 people, greatly simplifying intrusion.
