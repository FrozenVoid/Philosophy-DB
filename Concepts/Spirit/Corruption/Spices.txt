Spices can have effect on specific
 chakras, that with repeated
 exposure to the spice,
 without any modulating influence
 will corrupt the chakra energy
 pattern to adapt with spice ingestion

 emotional effects and force
 host to emit significant astral
  energy(emotional outbursts),
  which attract astral parasites,
  which attach to host and manipulate
  his mind to increase consumption
  of the spice to unhelathy levels,
  which attracts more astral parasites..
