Swimming drains etheric body,
especially diving and subsurface
 activity.
 
Corruption of astral body:
A.Weakening due elemental opposition:
Water displaces Air(astral energy).
The soul elemental balance requires
 Air-water balance, typically changed
 by fluid consumed. Here the entire
 body is grounded in Water.
 forcing the Astral body to shrink down.
 
B.Water-borne etheric entities
 may attach: the swimmer isn't
 native lifeform and lacks
 any etheric defense in water,
 unlike e.g. fish, which have
 adaptations for etheric body.
 
Weak etheric body due constant
Water-grounding will also allow
 intrusion of astral parasites
 when recovering after swimming:
the swimmer is however protected
during swimming(the motivation
to swim for leisure is often astral parasite intrusion)
 since native Astral lifeforms hate water
 and seawater especially due its
  salt content.
