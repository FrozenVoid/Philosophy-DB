In subtle planes, the resonance of person's
chakras vibrating at specific frequencies due
music, creates an energy fountain that allows
parasitic astral/mental/etheric entities to
locate and attach to source of 
'musical vibration',
often influencing the person musical 
'taste' towards more energy output and greater
emotional investment in music:
the tendrils of such entities stimulate
brain centers when resonance of chakras 
reach favored states.
