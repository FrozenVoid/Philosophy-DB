Musical pieces can be anchored to specific
emotional memories or broad emotional states.
The use of music as aid to 'repeat' emotional
states and remember memories lost, is 
a mechanism by which music dependence is 
created: the emotional dependence on music
restructures memory towards lower situational 
awareness(e.g. 'living in the past') where
repeat listening to evoke past memories 
dissociates one from current situation,
usually as form of escapism or avoidance of
real-world routine(mundane, bland activity,
that is 'enriched' with music).
