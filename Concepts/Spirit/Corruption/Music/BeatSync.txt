The brainwave background is heavily influenced
by sounds: from electric hum of domestic appliances
to beat-centric music. This is form 
of brainwave entrainment.

Main beat:
Music produced with specific beat frequency
e.g. 90 beats-per-minute, will introduce a
specific brainwave peak at each (e.g. 1.5hz 90/60)
as listener 'adapts' to entrainment.

Instrumental beat:
Periodic beats of Nhz will introduce this
frequency to astral/etheric body.
The 'vibration' synchronization to specific
beats will produce behavioral changes due 
emotional energy flows in chakras 'synced'
with the periodic beat:
this occurs with
specific chakras differently as their resonant
frequencies are reached from different beats,
with some astral/etheric bodies having different
sizes/shapes of chakras and corresponding resonant
 frequencies.
