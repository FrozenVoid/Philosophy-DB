Musical pieces influence perception of 
song lyrics via 'Sympathethic Alignment':
as mind accepts the melody, the lyrics are
subconsciously absorbed and treated in similar
manner - 'good melody -> good lyrics'.

Lyrics is the payload of music:
Lyrics are high-level mental payloads that
require appropriate voice and melody to
achieve virality and resonate with audience:
this process is using mechanical qualities
of a song(timbre, voice character, melody,instruments)
to create quality of expirience that 
evokes sympathy for lyrical payload:
The subconscious enjoyment of melodic progression
and resonance with frequency sets, create
a background state of unconditional 
'Sympathethic Alignment' that evolves with
repeat listening to 
acceptance of lyrical content or with 
purely instrumental songs, the background
verbal/textual/visual content bundled with
the song: song names, references, descriptors and
atmosphere evoked are interpreted in favor of
sympathethic alignment just due proximity;
similar effects occur with videos wheres
music is used as 'background'(i.e. priming
for sympathy with video content).
