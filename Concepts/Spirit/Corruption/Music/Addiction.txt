 
As brain expiriences 'resonance' with specific
frequency sets, a feeling of pleasure occurs
due neurological processes thay treat the absorbtion
of musical piece as 'reward' reached,
with gradual tolerance and adaptation,
forcing the user to seek novel sources of
the stimulating frequency sets:
the newer musical sets gradually erase
tolerance to old pieces, allowing the user
to enjoy them again.
