Sunlight, while harmful to 
 astral parasites, is harmful
 for astral body.
 
The effect of sunlight is moderated
by clothing and hair, but
will increase the Fire element at
expense of Earth: this
increases aging and also harms
 Astral body as the Fire overloads
 the circuits of Air, first
 forcing expansion(euphoric/positive)
 and then overflow(overheating).
In overheating/overflow phase the Astral
body is like a fountain of energy
in astral plane and is expanded beyond
 its safe limit due generous
 Fire elemental flow, which 
allows astral intrusion as emotiona
 disturbance of overheated person
 sheds bursts of astral energy
 at slightests action.
 
 Q;Should one avoid the sun?
 Limited exposure is fine and increases Fire,
 however it depends on sunlight intensity.
