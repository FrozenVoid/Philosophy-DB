Clocks generate a beat in delta
 range (about 1hz typically)
 which puts the astral and mental
 body into trance, this reduces
 their defenses against astral/mental
 intrusion (Delta brainwave),
 typically 1hz is only reached
 in deep sleep, which is useful
 for regeneration/relaxation but
 the constant beat of 1hz will 
 distort normal sleep pattern
  which will have to adapt to clocks.
  
  Corruption:
  Astral body adaptation to clocks
  is gradual reduction of emotional output,
  general passivity 
  and eventual trance-like
   state of soul. When clocks
   are removed/stopped the reaction
   will be compensatory psychosis
   as vata overload/compensation turns
   the astral body bursts to life
 creating disbalance and seeking back
 the comfort of trance-like state,
   
  Effects of clocks are moderated
  with distance and presence of
  other noises, like e.g. fridges,
  fans,birds etc which have aperiodic patterns
   without central rthythm.
   
  Additional effect:
  Clockwise movement increases
   Yang energy in a room in small
   amount dependent on rotating
   elements size. This has a
   somewhat invigorating effect
   which in large clocks compensates
   the delta beats in part:
  The artificial environment
  of multiple loud clocks is
  a complex etheric state which
  may attract attention on Etheric
  plane or disrupt normal building 
  energy to new vibrations.
  
  Time and Attention energy:
  Preoccupation with time increases
   stress and local level of vata(Air/Ether),
   which clocks as subject of attention
   will provide plenty: the energy
   deposited on clocks(ticking or
    not) due attention is immense waste
    of human spirit.
