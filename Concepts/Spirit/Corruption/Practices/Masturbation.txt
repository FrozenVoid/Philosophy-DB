Energy expelled during masturbation is 
extremely attractive e food sourc for
variety of non-physical entities that
can sense its presence from far away.

Parasitic attachments:
From astral worms attached to sacral chakra
to succubus possession, masturbation-related
entities stimulate production of Water-element
and corrupt Air(Emotional/Astral energy)
which lowers overall state of subtle bodies
towards centering on sacral chakra(genitals).

Elemental state:
Water element abudance is merely a symptom
of corruption and does not mechanically provide
relief, as Sacral(water) chakra is forced
to operate in extreme 'masturbation state' to
provide entities with constant energy source:
Increasing Air will just make the Water energy
more enticing and seductive, as Astral(Air) entities can
manipulate etheric brain channels that control
the sexual drive(libido) to feed.

Supression of sex drive:
The overall tendency to force a state of
sexual purity has to sustain the output
of sacral chakra: this is called sublimation,
however the energy expelled through higher
chakras will feed the attached entities.

The more practical pathway requires 
dissociation of emotional(Air) and instinctual
(Water) desires, to deny astral emanations during
masturbation(i.e. mechanical masturbation without emotion
or mental activity(fantasy))
and reducing overall 'appeal' of
energy expelled: gradually this will starve
entities of their preferred vibration and
allow to use more forceful methods of control:
sacral chakra then can be healed by
balancing kapha element(Earth-Water) and
rejecting exposure/influence of
trigger stimuli(Sexual content fueling fantasy state).

Mental fantasy:
mental parasites sustain from emotional
emanations that occur during focused
attention to sexual fantasy:
This 'daydream sequence' is controlled by
higher-chakra parasites looking to hook
some astral energy and ultimately causes
uncontrolled masturbation within fantasy state,
which would redirect energy towards 
'fantasy object' that is parasitic tulpa used
for channelling victim's energy to the mental
parasites: such entities have a complex understanding
of psychological weakness and personal flaws,
to craft sexual fantasies and redirect mental
chatter towards 'daydream sequence' that would
open circuits to sacral chakra and heart chakra:
emotional manipulation and molding of 
mental dependence on 'sexual fantasy' state
as relief and source of pleasure is their
natural goal. 


Succubus:
A more dangerous source of masturbation addiction
is a possesion by succubus spirit, which
has direct control over chakras:
Unlike mental/astral parasite, the subversion
is more total and attachment comes from
deeper interaction - the victim is bound
to succubus/incubus spirit energetically
and will require severing subtle cords
in etheric and astral plane:
the source of succubus/incubus binding
is a sexual dream where the parasitic spirit
attaches to etheric body and envelops the 
hosts aura with its own, supressing free will
and limiting energy interaction with environment.
