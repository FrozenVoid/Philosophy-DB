The simple, automated act of breathing
can be corrupted:
The state of so-called 'vata-overload'
or vata psychosis, which results
from overabudance of Vata and higher
chakra activity, creates
a special breathing pattern,
that is observed as 'labored breathing'
or manually breathing:
this infuses prana with nervous 
 states of extreme stress,
 which may create tulpa or attract
  astral parasites.
  Corruption come where
  this state of 'stress breathing'
  is amplified by acquired tulpa
  or astral parasite to become
  an automated, reflexive response
  to any stress, feeding the entities
  with more prana.
