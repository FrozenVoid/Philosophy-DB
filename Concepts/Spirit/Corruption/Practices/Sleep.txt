Sleep is actually Astral projection
with limited lucidity, due
 most humans having crown chakra
 parasites(Castaneda calls them Flyers)
 that direct the soul in dreams.
These dreams are usually 
a feeding frenzy for various
 astral entities, draining of energy
 and corruption due limited
  mental presence allowing the 
  crown chakra parasite to easily
  confuse the soul into harmful 
  energetic exchanges and attachment
  of extra astral parasites.
