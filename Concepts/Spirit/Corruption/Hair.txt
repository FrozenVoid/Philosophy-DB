Hair weak etheric
 fields lack quantity(unlike e.g. fur)
 to protect its place from
 astral parasites, which can 
 attach easily to hair even 
 if the body can repel them:
 Hair is the common intrusion vector
for astral parasites, though
some areas like head/genitals
 have a protective effect due
 fur-like density.

Hair nerves will be manipulated
 to bring emotional energy from
 the host, attention to hair
 and stress from constant
  micro-tugging and itching
  at etheric level:
  this is 'chronic source' of corruption
  for most people.

Long hair:
Long hair is especially vulnerable,
as it can detach from etheric field
with wind and clothing choices.
Long hair does increase 'sensitivity'
to etheric fields but this
is rarely innate and usually
astral parasites sending their
sensations to hair follicle
as the hair moves.


Baldness: Crown chakra defense
 requires some hair density to prevent
  direct contact with etheric(
  though for esoteric purposes
  one can remove it, like monks do:
) that most people are not
comfortable with: the lack
of astral parasites attached
to head hair also
 changes one aura(which has social influence).
 

Head hair can be simulated with wearing
 hats/caps however the inorganic
 objects lack natural hair's etheric fields
 and in case of dark colors
 will drain the host's crown chakra
 field, lowering it below plain
  baldness.
