A stress imprint is emotional-astral
energy bound to food produced
within range of stressful events,
specifically preparation of 
initial material and combination
of food components.
The astral/mental energy of
food producer mixes
with elemental structure of 
food etheric matrix.

Animals: if an animal
is used to produce food 
its entire combined energy
state will influence food's
energy composition in all elements.

Plants and fungi:
plants and fungi have astral-etheric
 shells(similar to subtle bodies
 of animals) which respond to
 eating and breakdown of components
 with outbursts of 'stress energy'
esp. when eaten raw or fresh.
