Emotional-astral energy at moment
of death
is attached(etheric death imprint) to
all food that is product of death
(departure of spirit and breakdown
of subtle body links),
from tiniest microbe to whales.
Consuming 'death imprint' energy
will create stress and eventual
 heart chakra(air/astral) corruption
 as the etheric dicharges
 of many death imprints accumulate.
