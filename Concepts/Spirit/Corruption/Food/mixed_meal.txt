A meal consisting of multiple
components, creates an etheric
disbalance during digestion,
which attracts astral parasites 
attaching to manipura chakra.
Elemental composition of foods
are often incompatible due energies
of materials(basic component properties
:color/taste/texture/density):
use of spices and additions create
a mixed-food item that has no
'natural frequency set' for the body
to adapt to.
