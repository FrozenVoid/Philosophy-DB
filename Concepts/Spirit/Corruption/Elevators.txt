Elevators allow vertical travel
for the etheric body, which
doesn't normal change its 
vertical location without 
horizontal movements.
The material world is embeded in
 etheric, where height of location
 has specific energy level:
The changing set of 'levels' have
different entities, but elevators
allow full vertical traversal
of entire set of these levels 
at once. Etheric entities
see elevators as concentrated
 source of energy with no option
 to move, a trap with humans.
 
Charging space:
Vertical movement leaves distinct
 ether trails and absorbtion of etheric
 residues on humans:
In return their etheric body slowly
dislodges from vital/physical domain 
due changes in etheric pressure(common
with elevators in skyscrapers).
The common elevator room is 
an etheric swamp with lifeforms
feeding or trying to attach to humans.

 
 
 
Elevator rituals:
Many internet legends and rituals
with elevators concern with 
intent of imagining a virtual
portal with specific content
at the destination. Suffice
to say this is dangerous and bring
 attention of Etheric predators.
