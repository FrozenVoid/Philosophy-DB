Smoke from any source from cigarettes
to forest fires, will corrupt
the elemental Air, using for
Astral body energy during breathing:
the chemicals in smoke corrupt
the 'prana'(Air element itself) 
energy in common air,
with various effects from
overloading chakras or draining
 them from energy(similar
 to spiced food changing its
 elemental pattern, except
 you can't stop eating air)

Astral body corruption
will transfer fast to soul itself due
scope of breathing process in
energy economics.
