Psychedelic is used here in a more broad
sense that include any drugs that alters
the mental body of its hosts.
The spirit connection to soul and subtle
bodies can be disrupted or compromised
 by ingesting specific matter:
Spices, Drugs, chemicals,etc
The host may even damage chakra
 channels by repeated ingestion
 of drug.

Problems:
1. Psychedelics lower subtle
body defenses, allowing other spirits
to interfere with our soul and spirit.

2.Chakras forced to operate 
on extreme regimes will damage
the subtle body that is connected with it

3.Mental distortion from psychedelics
will alter mental body, and soul
 energy patterns: especially 
 various 'research chemicals'
 that our subtle bodies lack any
 adaptation to(unlike e.g. plants/fungi).
