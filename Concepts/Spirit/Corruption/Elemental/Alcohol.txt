Alcohol enables demonic possession
by eroding subtle body links,
starting with vital and etheric
body, gradually weakening the 
soul subtle-body cords and chakra
 bindings, which allow deeper
possesion and replacement of soul
(as complex of linked 
subtle bodies(soul) is dissociated into
 unlinked entities):
the resulting hybrid entity depends on
alcohol to keep the original
soul(though the spirit is present)
out of body 
(to which it will 
inevitably returns as alchohol 
 wears off and cords/links/bindings
 are restablished).
via dissociation enabled by
alcohol.

Other dissociative drugs can
have similar effects,
(causing 'blackout' i.e. disconnect
 of mental body).
