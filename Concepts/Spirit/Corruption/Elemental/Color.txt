Subtle bodies of high chakras
are harmed by dark colors,
especially black.
These subtle bodies have a more
direct connection to soul.
Example: wearing a black hat,
this severely harms third eye and crown.

Black(or any really dark) color drains energy of nearest
chakras, however it also drains energy
of attached entities that are parasitizing
on that chakra and starves them.
