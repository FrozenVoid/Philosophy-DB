Souls in proximity adapt their
subtle body components to
reach a compromise 'average' configuration
that is at conflict with
natural state of soul,i.e.
disbalance from mean.
As distance of elemental 
interaction lowers, the elemental
channels of opposite polarity
will cancel to lowest common
energy state that is "average
 energy density of channel":
 this will happen to all channels
 as interaction continues,
 
Corruption:
The energy state of the soul
determines planar attachments
and alignments(personality/character)
which is corrupted by close
contact of distinct soul:
However in rare situations when
compatible or mutually beneficial
soul configurations align,
they can improve both energy 
states by reducing disbalance(
i.e. removing extreme states 
in favor of 'safer average' that
adds energy to weaker channel from
overflowing strong channel),
that can either result in 
mutually-beneficial relationship
or energy vampirism if the donor
party energy channels are not
replenished as fast as consumed.
