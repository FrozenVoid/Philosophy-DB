Egocentrism creates tulpas 
of Self, a distict person from
the spirit which demands constant
 attention(stress over one's 
 form and public image)
 and focus(narcissism).
The egocentric tulpa(s) 
(multiple egocentric tulpas can exist) corrupt
the soul into seeking comfort for
its internal state(ruled by tulpas)
that affect spirit's energy field.

The formation of such tulpa 
comes from intense bursts of emotional-astral 
 energy where Self-expression is
  involved or is supressed somehow:
The new Tulpa is a mirror image
of Self(the mental circuits that
define the person) but is weaker
and more corruptible, which allows
 external influences to mold it
 with emotions connected with Self:
 the actual Self is supressed in favor
 of dynamic, growing tulpa(s) that
 feed on attention(emotional-astral energy)
  ultimately seeking energy vampirism
 which corrupts the Soul for easy
  astral energy(e.g. fame) for the fictional
  persona(directed by its tulpa).
