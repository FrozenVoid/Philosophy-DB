Crowds allow astral/mental/etheric
 parasites to easily infect 
 thousands due close approach
 of people auras. 

Crowds synchronize chakra emanations
which effectively grants a crowd
a common aura, a temporary egregore
of crowd's intent, which allows
its members to share parasites 
who will spawn/attach eggs at 
close contact: the shared crowd aura
 nullifies internal defenses as
 the crowd exhibits mass phyhosis
 trance state, further decreasing
the ability of victims to resist.

The new astral/mental/etheric 
parasites will initiate spiritual
corruption after succesful attachment
which allow egregores and
 powerful spirits more access.
