Gambling corrupts astral body by forcing 
it to focus emotion on random events(i.e. chaos)
This chaos intrusion of randomly
generated emotional states, weakens
mental defenses and charges
one with anticipatory dread,
allowing astral/mental
parasites(spirits with mental body)
to influence host to more gambling
which further corrupt the astral body
 to a state where gambling is
 used for generating large emotional-astral
  energy flow for feeding the parasites.
