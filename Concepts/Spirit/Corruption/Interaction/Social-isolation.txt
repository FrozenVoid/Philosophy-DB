An untrained individual in social
isolation is more vulnerable
to mental intrusion via stress
due social exclusion,
normally perceived
as 'voices', 'intrusive thoughts'
etc, These are mental parasites
and represent specific spirits
that will try to corrupt the soul
 using telepathic or direct attachment
 to vulnerable extroverted people.
