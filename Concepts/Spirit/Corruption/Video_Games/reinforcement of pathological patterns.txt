In-game reinforcement of pathological patterns:
A game value system rewards most pragmatic
and ruthless value-maximizing behavior as its
mechanics are numeric equations with simple
functional metrics: an AI maximizing some
variable would also stumble on such a
pattern, which is considered optimal for 
in-game progression. The race to the top
of "achievement hierarchy" forces players to
learn most pragmatic, ruthless and mechanical
patterns of behavior(e.g. speedrun sequences)
that instill pathological neural circuits,
that the brain re-learns and values as real-world
'skills', similar to a primitive neural network
that would specializes in a game - removing all 'superflous'/'inefficient'
 behavior modes in favor of fast
 twitch-based emotional-reflexive judgement,
 that is optimal in-game but pathological outside
 of it.
