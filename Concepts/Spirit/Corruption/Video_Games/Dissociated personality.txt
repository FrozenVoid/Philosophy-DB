A constructed avatar of player or its abstract
representation as a persona of control is 
detached from mental field of players world:
this is actually a source of tulpa-avatar
of players "gaming persona" - dissociated from
real-world affairs the 'gaming persona' is 
also insulated from moral and ethical concerns
of the world: this aligns with pragmatic/egoistic
lifestyle that a game value system
constructs that also allows to roleplay 
a less constrained personality which a player
'tulpa-forces' as his outward social persona
inside a game(even in single-player).
