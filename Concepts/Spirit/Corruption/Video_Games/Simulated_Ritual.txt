A simulated ritual is a video game behavior
pattern that is instilled by gameplay mechanics:
usually this is a process by which some occult
practice(e.g. sacrifice) is normalized and
reinforced for gameplay reward, but games could
promote specific behavior that is essentially
a Virtual Ritual that a player charges with his
intent: 
a mundane example would be a chance-based
event on which the player spends attention;
such as crafting random item, summoning chance-based
 entity, gambling with random outcome,etc.

Why its corrupting:
Pragmatic value system:
A game value system bypasses moral inclinations
of most players by using virtual reward and penalty
for adhering to its internal structure:
optimal gameplay would therefore make player
to supress his internal value judgement in favor
of pragmatic in-game advantage.

Dissociated personality:
A constructed avatar of player or its abstract
representation as a persona of control is 
detached from mental field of players world:
this is actually a source of tulpa-avatar
of players "gaming persona" - dissociated from
real-world affairs the 'gaming persona' is 
also insulated from moral and ethical concerns
of the world: this aligns with pragmatic/egoistic
lifestyle that a game value system
constructs that also allows to roleplay 
a less constrained personality which a player
'tulpa-forces' as his outward social persona
inside a game(even in single-player).

In-game reinforcement of pathological patterns:
A game value system rewards most pragmatic
and ruthless value-maximizing behavior as its
mechanics are numeric equations with simple
functional metrics: an AI maximizing some
variable would also stumble on such a
pattern, which is considered optimal for 
in-game progression. The race to the top
of "achievement hierarchy" forces players to
learn most pragmatic, ruthless and mechanical
patterns of behavior(e.g. speedrun sequences)
that instill pathological neural circuits,
that the brain re-learns and values as real-world
'skills', similar to a primitive neural network
that would specializes in a game - removing all 'superflous'/'inefficient'
 behavior modes in favor of fast
 twitch-based emotional-reflexive judgement,
 that is optimal in-game but pathological outside
 of it.
