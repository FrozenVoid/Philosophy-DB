A simulated ritual is a video game behavior
pattern that is instilled by gameplay mechanics:
usually this is a process by which some occult
practice(e.g. sacrifice) is normalized and
reinforced for gameplay reward, but games could
promote specific behavior that is essentially
a Virtual Ritual that a player charges with his
intent: 
a mundane example would be a chance-based
event on which the player spends attention;
such as crafting random item, summoning chance-based
 entity, gambling with random outcome,etc.
