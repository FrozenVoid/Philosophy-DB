A game value system bypasses moral inclinations
of most players by using virtual reward and penalty
for adhering to its internal structure:
optimal gameplay would therefore make player
to supress his internal value judgement in favor
of pragmatic in-game advantage.
By game mechanics, numerical advantages are
only 'real' effects of any choice or pattern,
which devalues non-mechanical aspects and
descriptors as fluff or optional background.
