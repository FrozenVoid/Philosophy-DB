Virtual agency is broad term to define the feeling
of control over virtual environment that is the core
drawing element of immersion: immersion depends on
self-reinforcing process of feedback and action from
the viewpoint of 'virtual agent' controlling the 
choices and direction of the game:
As player imagines given (fictional) control over 
game environment his attention is directed towards
feedback from game world and reactive(learned) responses
that try to reach the players goal - the direction of
'virtual agency' is inherently shaped by game mechanics
but its goal can be any reward or condition:
the freedom to choose any path and any strategy,
experiment and tinker with builds and tactics create
a 'space of creative freedom'(largely absent in 
real-world environments) which promote 
alignment with 'virtual agency' instead of less appealing
and high-effort 'physical agency';
usually resulting in neglect of real-world affairs,
and externally visible as addiction to gaming.
