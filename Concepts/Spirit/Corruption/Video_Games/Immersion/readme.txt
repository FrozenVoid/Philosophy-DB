Immersion is the main mechanism that allows
video games to deeply
influence and change players psyche.
The freedom and lack of negative feedback 
in most games create psychological outlets for
creative impulses and para-social relations,
presenting a fictional-imaginary world satisfying 
escapist fantasies and providing material to daydreams
(essentially
a lite version of tulpaforcing and wonderland generation)
