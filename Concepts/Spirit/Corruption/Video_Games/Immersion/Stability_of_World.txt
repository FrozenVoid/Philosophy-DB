The comfortable and stable existence
inside a game world anchors the expirience in
players mind as if a 'wonderland' was constructed
with game contents: the anchoring within the
game world is most prominent where player
feels as if he returning home or expiriencing
nostalgia of some past world setting where he
can feel security of presence: the player tulpa
is the 'anchoring block' that creates this
feeling of belonging to a fictional-imaginary
wonderland setting and reinforces nostalgic
feelings towards the artificial environment 
that game graphics and sounds try to portray.
