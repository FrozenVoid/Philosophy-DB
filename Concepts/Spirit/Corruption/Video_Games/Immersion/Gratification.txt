Games provides instant and delayed gratification,
with latter representing 'in-game time investment'
and former being 'in-game positive feedback'.
The heuristic humans use to gauge 'reward' in
virtual worlds creates a distorted value
of gratification: available gratification in-game
outranks most mundane activities, due even
small rewards appearing continiusly and their
predictable trajectory of appearance allow
investment in time-energy that many players
view as justified - in reality the trick is
game mechanics provide a psychologically
appealing 'ladder of achievement' where
player is enticed to invest more effort per
proportional reward(while in real-world rewards
do not have such proportional investment) which
is perceived as fairness:
this learned pattern is transferred towards
comparing real-world tasks which are 
high-effort/low-reward, making them appear
unappealing and unfair by design.

Game immersion stems directly from 
this perception of fairness and predictable
mechanics of investment/reward, as player
can predict and expect rewards more successfully
that he can predict real-world events.
