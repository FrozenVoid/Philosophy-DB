It is a common misconception that realism
automatically provides immersion. Nothing
could be more wrong: realism provides more
direct comparison with real-world objects that
trigger immersion breaks where virtual objects
show their 'irreality' and artificial quality.
Abstract and less realistic art styles(such as anime)
provide far more insidious type of immersion
that is more detached from real-world concerns,
aka 'bright and fluffy' aesthethic which
allows to incorporate more sinister themes and
behavior patterns inside a game that would
look jarring if it were realistic:

Example A:
A Mario player avatar stomps on a virtual
turtle vs human breaking a turtle shell and 
killing a turtle that spreads its guts on death.
The former would be far more palatable
to a child playing a game, which look very
abstract and clean(as pixel art) -
the 'realistic version' gory details would
be more realistic but they would detract
from immersion formed within the game.

The abstract-simplified graphics and
reduced realism allow game design freedom
of exploring any behavior pattern that
could be imposed on a player - cues from
game world can overpower realism as game
mechanics values are learned by a player.
