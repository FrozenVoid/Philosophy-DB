The insulated character of game world and
its stability allow players to experiment:
various creative strategies/tactics/patterns
of gameplay and ability to alter game contents
create an avenue of 'free creativity' where
player assume innate positive quality of 
any creative choice due being insulated from
negative effects and consequences of such choices.

Example:
A player who dislikes death and black magic,
might play a necromancer inside a video game as
expirimenting and roleplaying is perceived
as necessary to fully explore and immerse oneself
inside a fictional setting: the presence
of some option in-game create a sense of 
curiosity and desire to explore it by assumption
of players that such parts of game are 
valid elements of design and exploratory space.
