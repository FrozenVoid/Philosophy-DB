The suspension of disbelief and immersion in
game behavior patterns, creates a potent distortion in
perception: optimal for in-game learning,
the player blends imagination and real-world
perception to construct a fictional belief
setting(a 'wonderland' in tulpamancer jargon)
where his 'gaming personality'(a tulpa)
develops as unique entity: a wonderland which
incorporates imaginary expectation of game
world transposed to real-world setting,
which bypasses value judgement from more
realistic (i.e. non-fantasy oriented) worldview
that is subverted by immersion in game setting(
e.g. imagining game entities in real-world
or ascribing realistic qualities to fictional
entities)
