Vehicles with closed form
like automobiles, collect ether during
 driving which disperses into
 the vehicle body(front first).
Excess ether charges the vehicle 
and its occupants, somewhat positively
 affecting mood. However with
 chronic exposure the etheric body
 is forced to expand beyond its
  capacity which attracts 
  astral parasites:
  the charged vehicles also act 
  as easy beacon in ether.
The vehicle vibrations due motor
will create a unique energy signature
for passengers as they're entrained
into the monaural beat rhythm by
their (expanded) etheric body.
