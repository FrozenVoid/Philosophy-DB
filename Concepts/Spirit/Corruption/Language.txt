Spiritual corruption through
 voicing thoughts via throat chakra
 'vocalization' can occur when language
 is shaped to
 promote specific elemental
  patterns lowering soul/subtle body
  to its level.
Examples:
1.Words that serve as mantras
to change flow of energy
from higher to lower chakra(Descent)
1A.Grounding/Draining of mental body by
using terminal letters(L) for
 Earth element in words that
begin with openers of high-chakra
 channels(e.g. M), such as 
 the word 'Mental' itself.

2.Causing disbalance by  using
words which contain letters
of opposing elements:
e.g. Fire and Earth-> infflamation
 Air and Water-> psychosis
These patterns corrupt throat chakra.
 
3. Using letter frequencies that invoke Hell
and Abyssal chakras, outside of
specific meditation to cleanse them.
