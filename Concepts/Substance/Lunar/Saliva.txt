Saliva is a lunar essence(kapha) which absorbs chakral
emanations of crown,third-eye and throat chakra.
Swallowing saliva at overabudance of water/south/kapha
 allows one to increase kapha without
 consuming it from food.
 
 Spitting out saliva (and whatever substances eaten)
 is a way to push this lunar kapha energy on an object:
 in some intuitive sense the 'spitting' is considered
 as debasing and lowering the common field
 of energy to kapha humor - to common state
 of source of spit which loses kapha and environment
 gaining it(a rebalancing/cleansing effect).
 The act itself
 is the pathway for depositing ether in forceful
 manner(the material part of spitting is merely 
 a vehicle) to mark the target as part of
 spitter etheric field.
