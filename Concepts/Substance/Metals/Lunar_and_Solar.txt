Metals in close proximity have
two categories of effect.

Lunar(Yin,dull/grey-white-silvery) metals
reduce energy(fire) - ultimately bringing
a dominant Kapha state. 

while Solar(
Yang, bright/yellow-gold) increase
 energy in the body, ultimately
 bringing a dominant Pitta humor state.
 
Metals and alloys can be 
classified by the chakra
they engage and Lunar/Solar
 polarity dominance:
proportion of Yin/Yang energy.

Vata state can't be reached
by metals due them depleting
 ether - however with elemental
 disbalances a Pitta state will
 boost Vata enough to counteract
 the depletion(this is unbalanced
 state of extreme Yang).
