A sufficiently advanced tulpa
is not different from a
mental plane parasite and can 
become one if the host programming
 causes it to be egoistic/egocentric,
 which will lead it to seek control
 of its energy source(host) through
 possession(direct chakra control) which
 will absorb negative human qualities
  to become another mental parasite
  as host ages and weakens his control
  over the tulpa.
  
Buddhist monks spend many years to
eradicate all ego attachments before
 trying tulpa creation for this exact reason
 and don't form interpersonal,intimate
  relations like modern tulpamancers.
