Imaginary scenarios and locations,
when focused long enough or
projected into via dreams/daydreams/
mental projections, will manifest
 as 'tulpa wonderland' as it gains
 energy and moderate autonomy,
however its real power is entities
 within(personas,tulpas,servitors,thoughtforms) which can interact
with the content of 'wonderland' 
as host of tulpa does with lucid
 dreams. A 'tulpa_wonderland' 
 created in a natural way, is 
similar to religious belief objectg
like 'heaven'/'hell', fed by 
mass belief(egregore wonderland).

Method of loci(memory palace),
is essentially
a voluntary variant of creating
a tulpa wonderland for utility value:
the servitor objects are placed
to store 'external memory' of host
