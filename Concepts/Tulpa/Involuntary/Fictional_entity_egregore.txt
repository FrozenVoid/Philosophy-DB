A tulpa of any popular
 fictional entity(or depiction
 of real entity as separate 'popular image of')
 will feed on large amount of energy
 and form cords to multiple hosts
 that will allow it to ascend to
 egregore status.

Belief in existence of any such 
entity, visual/aural/tactile reinforcement
of its form will allow the egregore
to attach to the next host,
e.g. belief that Mario is real,
during playing a videogame will
eventually attach to Mario-egregore entity
due focus and 'suspension of disbelief'.

Suspension of disbelief is 'faith in existence': ':
This is the 'immersive mechanism' 
responsible to creation and linking
with egregores of fictional entities,
broadly similar to 'faith in deity' and
spiritually equivalent to worship
 rituals that use imagined connection
 to deities as basis for belief:
 imagination is a mental plane
 formation catalyst that will eventually
 form a series of energy-loops that
 transform to thoughtforms converting
 their combined energy to tulpa,
 which grow to egregore-class mental 
 parasites, linking with other people
  beliefs/faith and becoming a real egregore.
