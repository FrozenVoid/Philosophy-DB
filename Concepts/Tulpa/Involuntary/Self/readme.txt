Self is the social identity tulpa,
the role-servitor of 'social status'
 that grows to independent tulpa
of complex public image as 
'external personality'.
Self is actually a fully externally
imposed tulpa dependent on social
approval and social status: it
appears in early enculturation as
role-servitors of culture egregore
assign the child his 
preliminary identity-servitor
 which is 'Self': with emotional
 focus this identity develops as
'Self' absorbs various role-servitors
and emanates secondary identity-tulpas.
