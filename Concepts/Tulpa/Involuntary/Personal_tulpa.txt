Personal tulpa, also known
as fetch/doppelg√§nger in folklore,
is a tulpa created by society for
the 'social image' of a person,
i.e. his mental plane 'person'.
by imagining or feeling/focusing on
 the person without a direct energy cord
 connection, the 'remote image'
 of person(expectation/default form)
 eventually attaches itself
 to the person: if the person is 
 famous enough the personal tulpa
 will overtake the mental body or
  attach to chakras for control.
  as multiple people produce
  a 'fame egregore' with vast energy
  reserves fed by mass belief.
  or alternatively a very persistent
   tulpamancer(e.g. 'stan'/fan of
   celebrity
   imagining a tulpa image of target).
