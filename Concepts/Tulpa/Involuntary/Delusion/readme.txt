Delusion is dissociation from
reality in favor of constructed
fantasy, a tulpa or role-servitor
 growing to control some aspect
 of mind. Psychologists are not
 aware that delusion is deliberate
  construction adapted for host's
  mental landscape, not a 
  'random stubborn belief' but an
  entity dictating and feeding on
  this belief: usually the host
 has some emotional weak point 
 that is a feeding source for 
 tulpa - initially a role-servitor
that comforts the host with a 
imaginary scenario which it
uses to gain rapport and project it
deeper as delusion to gain more energy
as host aligns with delusion's content
