The dominant culture egregore 
requires personal tulpas to 
develop in children to spread 
control(cords to tulpas), This process
(enculturation) is establishment
of new tulpa by parents and educators
 using various training models which
 child imitates(and will transfer to
 their own children) as part of his
 personality(ego-tulpa), forming linked  
 cultural role-servitors in 
 mental body which perform cultural
 roles expected of children, as usual
 these role-servitors grow to tulpas
 with spent emotional energy and constant
 focus on performing as 'part of culture'.
