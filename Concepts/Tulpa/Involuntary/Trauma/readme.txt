Expirience of trauma will create
a tulpa, which will use trauma 
memory to extract host energy,
thus focusing on the trauma will
extend its reach.
Trauma tulpas are essentially
a pure example of mental parasites,
they gain immense amounts of 
emotional-astral energy and give
the host more suffering to reinforce
the 'triggering memory'(actually
tulpa's mental body dissociated
from main memory) which tulpa
repeats during feeding.
