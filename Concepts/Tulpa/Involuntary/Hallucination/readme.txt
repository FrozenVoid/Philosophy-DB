Hallucination can be defined as
 projected mental imagery from
 a tulpa that gains emotional
 energy of host responding to 
hallucation, as if the tulpa
was trolling the host.
Treating the hallucination as
real further solidifies the tulpa
 position and grants it more
 power(which is its ultimate goal)
 as hallucination converts to
 involuntary 'tulpa wonderland' to
 be later imposed on host's vision.

Drug-induced hallucinations if
not being a mental projection(
limited to psychedelics) is likely
a work of tulpa picking and matching
memory pieces to construst a
hallucinatory projection that
 exist because host lost control
 of mental body(drug influence) 
 which allows tulpas( people
 have many involuntary/natural 
 tulpa/servitors embedded, except
 some monks and ascetics) to
 assert influence: this influence
 is control of mental imagery that
 is normally driven by mental body,
 however as mental body loses contro
 of mindscape dynamics,
 its components(internal servitors) and
 mental parasites(tulpa/
 servitors/attached entities) 
 start running the show, competing
 for mindstream focus(mental energy)
 and emotional output(astral energy, heart).
