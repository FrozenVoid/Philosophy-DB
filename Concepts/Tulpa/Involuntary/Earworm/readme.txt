Earworm is a tulpa of a song/melody
 which has a self-reinforcing
 energy pattern, using host emotional
 response as feeding source:
the 'voice' of tulpa repeats
the most 'triggering' melody/lyrics
 from memory(can be multiple pieces).

Earworms are probably the most
 familiar type of tulpa to most
 people, though they don't understand
 that earworm is a mental parasite
 with its own mind - not a single
 instance of 'stuck song' but an
 entity feeding on all of them.
