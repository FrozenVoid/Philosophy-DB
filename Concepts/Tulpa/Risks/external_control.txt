Tulpas can be controlled by 
spirits by attachment of energy
 cords or possession at mental
 plane: tulpas however can be
 protected by host with various
 shielding techniques and general
 prevention of spiritual intrusion
 used for body/room/place.

Tulpa wonderlands however cannot
be protected without advanced methods
and deliberate construction,
as their location is mental plane
 projection of the host's mental
 body(field-like/aura?) not a
 concrete entity but equivalent
 to dream areas in astral plane.
