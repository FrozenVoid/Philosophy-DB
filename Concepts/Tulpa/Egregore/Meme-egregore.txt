All memes are egregore entities which
can attach to mental bodies of
their hosts with sufficient connection,
the meme egregores are distinguished
by being primary astral due 
emotional energy fed into memes.

A connection with a meme allows
the host to expirience the energy
of 'hivemind'(egregore of the meme)
and form emotional links with 
other worshippers of the egregore
who spread the image/pattern of 
the meme, like a small primitive religion,
