All memes forms as tulpa projections
of its creator: usually
this is the same person who create
the media substrate of the tulpa,
however 'first infector' can be
anyone who begins to spread the
meme, forming the initial egregore
 character, as meme gains influence
 over its hosts(personal tulpas) that
 combine their energy by cords,
 forming an overmind-tulpa, which
 is the final egregore form.
 
 Hierarchy of powers:
 
 1.Egregore of the meme:
 connects all meme-tulpas by
 mental cords. Forms from prolonged
'meme worship', proto-cultural 
creative efforts and focused attention
of many people viewing and sending 
emotional energy to media substrate
of the meme.

 2.Meme-spreader tulpa:
 established tulpa of meme that
 occupies a prominent place in
 mindscape and is directly
 connected to egregore,
which causes intense desire to
spread/improve/expand the meme
as proto-cultural unit(of egregore).
 
 3.Meme-consumer tulpa:
 The user collects and consumes
 instances of the memes, feeding
 own personal tulpa connected to
 specific meme-spreader tulpa
 by mental cords, eventually linking
 to greater egregore as influence
 of meme causes creative impulses
 of modification/alteration and 
 mutation to create new consumable
 content independent of meme-spreader
  control(advancing to #2).
 
 4.Meme-servitor tulpa:
 the human who encounters the meme
  early with minimal attention and
  dismisses its payload, but shows
  interest in external appearance.
 The servitor forms as curiosioty
 about the meme lead the host to
 explore similar memes and generally
  absorb parts of meme culture,
  forming a meme-consumer tulpa.
