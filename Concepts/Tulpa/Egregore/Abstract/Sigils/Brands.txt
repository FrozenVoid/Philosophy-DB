Brands are sigils of products and
companies which link consumers with
 concept-egregore of brand,
 by mental association and formation
 of consumer-brand energy relation.
 
The 'science' of brands is actually
 category of techniques that
 use(often without understanding)
 mantra patterns and colors
 to entice consumer attraction 
 and loyalty:
 colors are picked to affect chakras
 connected to the brand,
 e.g. Orange(sacral,Water) and Red(root,Earth)
 create Kapha-humor emotions and
  basic desires of food/water linked
  to a brand name,
  brand names are mantric patterns
  which exploit elemental energy
  of letters to instill a unique
 emotional/mental pattern that is
 repeated by consumers unconsciously
 and linked with the brand-product,
 just as normal mantras link with egregore
  ruling the energy pattern.
