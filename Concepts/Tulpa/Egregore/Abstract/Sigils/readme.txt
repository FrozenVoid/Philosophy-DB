Sigils are linked to egregores 
or entities controlling egregores,
by similar way a 'name' is a mantra
 pattern used for summoning it.

Sigils vs names:

Sigils are direct graphical 
embodiment of energy pattern which
 is not bound by language/font/letter
 geometry(as normal names are limited), which when
 infused with user's energy by focused
 attention will open connection from
 sigil to entity linked to it,
 or if none exist will start forming
 a new tulpa(which will become 
 egregore of the sigil in time).
 
Names are an abstract, referential
 mantric pattern which depends 
 on proper vocalization and
 language recognition.
 Brand names are just words,
 but their unique representation
 is the sigil.
