Building egregore or 'house spirit'
is the tulpa of 'house image' 
absorbing enough astral-emotional
 energy to manifest an egregore.

Building egregores are connected
to local city/village egregore,
though their architecture and 
internal features give them 
specific character and energy 
substrates.
