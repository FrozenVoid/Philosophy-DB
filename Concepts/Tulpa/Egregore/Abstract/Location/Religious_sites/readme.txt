Sites where energy of worship
is sent into the ether will
form an egregore(from 
shared states) or attract the
 nearest one to site:
Egregores will attach to buildings,
or hover above to absorb maximum
 energy. More ancient sites will
 have more powerful egregores,
as uninterrupted feeding of 
mass worship energy allows fast
growth. 
These egregores depends on
friendly architecture(which is 
of course influenced by them) to
focus energy upward and prevent
energy loses(metal roofs, mirrors
and metal parts) - so they don't
need to enter into building
as building-egregores do(and
which also avoid metal).
