Location egregore, 'spirit of place'
is a bounded egregore that 
controls and feeds on specific
location and contends with
other egregores over boundaries
(liminal spaces where neither
 have control) to spread influence
 sphere(location of feeding).

Power depends on population
density(animals included);
Egregores of locations 
can control space from rooms
to geographical locations 
as large as mountain ranges.
