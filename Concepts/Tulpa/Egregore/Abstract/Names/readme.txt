Names have their own energy pattern
which absorbs energy directed
'at the name', a collective egregore
of all entities with shared
 name, that links to the mental
 and causal bodies by association
 of name-entity-group with specific
 instances of name, as 
 a word-ergregore links with
 underlying instances of the word-object.
