Any food product from general
class of foodstuffs(e.g. dairy)
to brand name chocolate, has an
attached egregore which influences
the producers and consumers in
a 'egregore food chain system':
1.A shared idea about food 
product or class of products 
delelops to concept-egregore,
2.that by virtue of being
focused on with specific chakras
 used in food digestion creates
 energy connections(addictions,
 preferences, tastes) to the 
 food-egregore
3.Motivating demand, supply side
 egregore connects to people
 creating the food item by their
 shared belief and focus on food
 production as their occupation,
 to modify or improve their food
 production.
4.The consumer-producer-distributor
network eventually falls under
egregore control, which forms
 industrial egregores(e.g. dairy
  industry) when groups of 
  food producers unify and standartize
  their 'local food egregores' linked
  with specific food production locations.
  
5.Brand egregores have an intimate
 relationship with external 
 appearance of food product,
 but their content is influenced
 by food-product egregores linked
 to consumers with cords,
 meaning a new product has to
 evolve 'familiarity'(cords) with
 consumers by linking the pre-existing
 food egregores.
