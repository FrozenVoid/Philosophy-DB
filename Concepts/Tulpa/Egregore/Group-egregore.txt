From crowds to corpotations, the
shared beliefs/emotions/mental
patterns focus on singular entity
that forms a 'group-egregore' which
is the 'magic glue' keeping the
group cohesive and influential.

Egregores of fanatic/military/criminal
groups can be powerful enough to
force its members to sacrifice themself
for the benefit of a group(actually shared egregore
cords). Grpup egregores are fed
with astral energy(emotion) and
 mental worship(focusing thoughts)
 which can generate entire religions,
 tribes and states with time.
 
Tribal egregores are egregores
of humans with generic links which
allows easier attachment to 
the mental body, esp. in children.
