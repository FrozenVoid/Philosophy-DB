A tulpa which feeds on multiple
hosts, has energy cords/connection
 to them and advanced its self-consciousness
 to level of spirit/soul, due
 shared spiritual energy and accumulation
 of karmic debt(attachment to a plane).
 
 Egregores can gain much energy from
 worship and form from fictional 
entities or shared abstract concepts

Abstract concepts have ancient and 
powerful egregores governing them
 from mental plane, like concept-of-gods,
 however unlike real gods they are limited
 in scope to single concept and are
 outranked due being secondary emanations
  created from lower planes.
