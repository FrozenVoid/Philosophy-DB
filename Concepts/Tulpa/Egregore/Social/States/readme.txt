A state is an 'national egregore'
that governs a cultural substrate of
society, as tribal egregore
 who grown to encompass multiple
 cultures aligned with it.

A state egregore extends control
through state-enforcer tulpas,
which form cords with egregore
as Agent Smith instances in the 
Matrix, the personal tulpa of
'state egregore' which forms
in state power-structure
and combined belief in
state power/importance feed the
egregore as religious worship
of deities does to cult ergregores.

The best way to understand 
state egregore is a 'deity of
 tribal elders' where nation 
 is a spiritual entity worshipped
 by ritual(sacred state attributes) and
 sacrifice(military allegiance to
 deity), a primitive tribal cult
 that has grown in complexity with
 time. Tribal elders mutated to
 state politicians, aristocracy
 and totalitarian rulers/kings who
 have a direct egregore connection
 by personal 'state tulpa' or
 role-servitor, but state is the same
 primitive egregore of tribal religion.
 
 Patriotism and Nationalism:
 Personal tulpas of specific 
 state egregores will often receive
 energy bursts, motivating its
 hosts to align with egregore's
 desires(influence expansion) as
 egregore-tulpa cords is stengtened
 and host begins to send emotional
 energy to egregore, as worship
 of state power, often supressing 
 personal desires in favor of intense
 religious adherence to collective 
 values instilled by egregore:
 ideological purity of 'state power'
 isn't as important to host as 
 egregore treats 'state enforcers' as
 replaceable pawns in grand competition
 between national/tribal egregores.
 
 Difference from tribal allegiance:
 National egregores are far more
 flexible in spreading their control 
 over the location, having multiple
  'centers of power' where major
  cities(city egregores) submit their
  hosts to national egregore control:
  however some city egregores grow
  sufficient power to wrestle control
  from national egregore to subsume
  local culture control.
  
  In religion the Powers/Principalities/
  Archons/Loosh Collectors of 
  top rank are actually political
   egregores of state power,
   currently manifested as 'nation-states'
   but can hold various forms
   from corporations to subcultures
   as 'tribal egregores' are
   equivalent of 'state powers' due
   being virtual tribes.
