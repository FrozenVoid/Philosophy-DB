A music genre is a subcultural
egregore which spreads it
cultural values to host's tulpas,
forming a new cultural layer that
centers on 'music worship'(
sending emotional-astral energy
to egregore), which egregore propagates
by feeding musicians intense
bursts of 'inspirational energy'
(astral/mental flows from egregore)
allowing them to easily connect to 
mental/astral entities eager to
influence culture, some of which
might possess the musicians through
 the 'musical tulpa'(e.g. during
 performance-trance states).
