A subculture is a cultural 
egregore that contends with
 'mainstream culture' egregore 
 for adherence(loyalty/identity)
similar to religious cults:
the subculture is more flexible
and adaptable egregore who understand
human desires and designs a 
'cultural layer' which they emulate
by spread of role-servitors(tulpa)
and media-substrates(information)
 created by subcultural agents
 who have direct connection to
 egregore and influence on secondary
 consumers(which can be later
 connected directly).
