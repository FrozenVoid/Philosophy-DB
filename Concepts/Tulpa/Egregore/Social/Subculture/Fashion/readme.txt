Fashion is an outward expression
of subcultural egregore, usually
limited to specific cultural 
context/location where subcultural egregore
has influence: the Self-tulpa
is often connected with egregore's
 tulpa of fashion as self-expression
 of social identity(Self) is performed
 by host to appease his fashion-tulpa
 energy demands - which often lead
 to harmful effects as clothing
 changes the aura and chakra 
 emanations(that creates emotional
 imbalance and grants more power
 to fashion tulpa).
