Egregore of a concept(e.g. money)
is a broadly shared entity with
energy cords penetrating vast 
majority of humans mental bodies,
whereas narrower concepts are 
dependent on constant reinforcement
 and focused attention to sustain
 an egregore,e.g. rare words.
 
Brpad outline:
Each concept,word or mental idea
of coherent form, has an egregore
attached.

Progression of concept-egregore:
From its creation 
as thoughtform to shared 
tulpa-word to growth into
multi-language abstract concept
egregore with energy feeding cords 
to everyone focused on it,
the concept has its own mind and
influences its own spread/use by
egregore's cords sending feedback or
 adding energy to specific hosts
 that egregores deems beneficial
 to spreading its influence.
