Tulpa is a mental construct/emanation  
that can gain sentience:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa

Understanding the mind as 
a tulpa-infested jungle instead
of 'scientific' models of agent networks
 will be more productive in
 spiritual advancement, 
 esp. mental plane.

1.Tulpas are parts of mental body
or 'attached organisms' similar
to astral parasites: tulpa
will also gain astral body by feeding
on emotional energy(Air/Astral/Heart chakra),
but simple mental focus will
 produce a tulpa anyway.


2.Tulpas can contain alternative
 personas, skills or supressed
 memories which they will use
 as bargaining chip for attention.

3.Tulpa are self-aware in a broad
sense: they can focus on their 
own location('tulpa wonderland')
and determine their own qualities.

4.Humans constantly produce tulpas
by feeding their mental loops
and fantasies enormous amount 
of energy. Mental loops are
specific energy patterns that
self-reinforce thoughtforms that
become tulpa with time.

5.Tulpa are not always 'human'
 they can be anything from
 abstract concept like 'money' to
  a 'home building tulpa'.

6.Souls can be produced from
 tulpa(used as substrate) by 
 sharing spiritual energy of
 any being of high spiritual
 rank(adding connection to collective soul)
  Buddhafields are tulpa
  wonderlands converted to realms
  or subplanes in same way.


7.Tulpas are not demons, but
demons can produce and control
 tulpas made by humans.
A concept of servitor spirit
is western analogue of tulpa
with limited sentience.
 Tulpas can be thought of
  a mental body projections 
  given autonomy.
