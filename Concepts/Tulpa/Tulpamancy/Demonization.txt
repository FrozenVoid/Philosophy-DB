Assignment of negative qualities
and energy towards tulpas which
 eventually grants them sufficient
 astral-emotional power to become
 demonic entities(that can grow
 to actual demons with time)
  separate from host control.
  
 Fear, repulsion and hate are 
 actually potent energy sources
 for tulpa construction.
