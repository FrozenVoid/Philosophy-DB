A habit is actually..a tulpa,
as behavior patterns are role-servitors
which gain a personality associated
with habit performance:
tulpa feed on attention, thus
 habits grow to create addictions
 and limit host energy flow to
 satisfy the habit-tulpa:

Formation of habit-tulpa is
 from a sequence of events 
 charged with strong emotional/mental
  energy that resulted in some 
  satisfactory reaction in host,
 an involuntary servitor script
  repeats and ends,
 the host merges it with mental
 body and dissociates during
 habit performance, with time
 giving sentience and subtle
 bodies(mental/astral usually) as
 servitor develops as separate
 tulpa.

1.tulpa is very sensitive
to set-and-setting,location
 when habit is performed.
The 'placebo effect' applies
 where tulpa is satisfied by
 'performance/roleplay' of
 habit reinforcing its servitor
 script(tulpa core).

2.tulpa of habit is often
linked with self-image, as
person mostly can't dissociate own
 habit from own persona, giving
 the habit-tulpa own qualities
 and treating own role-servitor
 as 'part of personality'.
 
 
3.specific chakra channels
may feed tulpa which causes it
to move in that location,
generating emotions/discomfort to feed on
 host emenations as tulpa
 gains separate astral body(Air/emotion),
 essentially becoming an internal
 astral parasite.
