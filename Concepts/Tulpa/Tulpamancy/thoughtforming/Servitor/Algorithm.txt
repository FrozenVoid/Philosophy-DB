At core of every servitor
there is a mechanical, sequential
 script that acts like an algorithm:
 Each step/part of a script is
 a language description of 
 a sub-task, which when completed
 moved to another sub-task as
 execution of script continues.
 
 Unlike robots/computers, servitors
 have some flexibility interpreting
 the script(sense of intent is important)
 combining energy of intent and
 mental imagery associated with 
 words into a coherent structure.
 
 Triggers/Condition:
 Algorithm is usually set in background
 as servitor isn't active all of 
 time, but when a triggering event
 is set, servitor spring to life 
 and takes control of host's mind
 to perform the script.
 
 Termination:
 Script can have multiple conditions
  for termination/exit, usually 
  at end, however it can also
  stall on specific step waiting
  for next condition/state to activate
  in a loop.
