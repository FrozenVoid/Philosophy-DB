Mnemonics is common technique to 
form association-cluster servitors
(which are called 'memory devices'):
It combines emotional context
with its associated cluster,
to form the servitor content.

Note:Emotional-mnemonic servitors will
eventually form tulpas due influx 
of emotional-astral energy,
unlike natural/mental-forcing association-clusters
which can remain mental constructs,
i.e. 'memory devices'.
