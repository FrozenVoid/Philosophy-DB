A servitor that controls a 
specific association-cluster in
memory and retrieves its content 
in response for mention by host,
as advice/reminder/memory amplifier.

Such servitors can form spontaneusly
 and even progress to tulpa state 
 with growing complexity, allowing
 them to define moods/beliefs/impressions
 by simple association with a trigger.
 
These type of servitors are integral
for efficient thinking by simplifying
 associative searches: similarity,
 category-content retrieval and category
  formation are much easier with
  a specific clustering servitor
  holding the associations as unit.
