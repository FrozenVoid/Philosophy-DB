A servitor is a thoughform of
a limited tulpa tasked with
specific aspects of mind or
skillset that host dissociates
from 'self' and assigns a role/script.

Unlike tulpa they don't require
a shape/form/persona and can 
be constructed purely as mental
 dialogue objects('voices' appear
 in same way).
Servitors can be taken over
by spirits much easier than
tulpas as they lack self-awareness
and are largely nonpersonal energy
 clouds configured by host,
 however they are easier to
 dismiss,ignore and defocus from
 unlike tulpa.

 
 
Types;
1.Scenario servitor "script-actor":
a NPC script that servitor
performs for host to automate
scenarios/fantasies/daydreams
- allowing host
to give control to 'role-persona'
as in roleplaying(which is 
actually a form of tulpamancy).
These servitors are often converted
into tulpas.

2.Role servitor "script-robot":
A mental construct that repeats
 advice/mental pattern
 or retrieves memories linked
 to its script.
Advanced role servitors can
automate thinking(reasoning),
skills and routines, as host
dissociates these mental functions
into separate entities.
These servitors deeply integrate
with the mental body.

3.Task servitor "magic agent":
a servitor is thoughtformed to
performs mental plane tasks,
gather information or change
some mental body parts/cords/connection
 that host is unable to or has
 limitations/difficulties with.
These servitors appear as most
 advanced and dangerous type,
 as spirits have better access
 to servitors separate from host.
