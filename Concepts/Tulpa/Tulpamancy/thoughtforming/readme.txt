Central technique pf tulpamancy:
thoughtforming(or Forcing/tulpaforcing) is
voluntary shaping and feeding of
 thoughtforms that will become 
 tulpas. All tulpas start
 as mental parasite forms,
 due extreme need in new energy
 to form new mental/astral bodies.

This is the common progression
of most 'tulpamancers',
as they don't dismantle tulpas.

Techniques typically used in
 temporal order:
1.Image creation: an object
in memory is shaped and imagined.
A vivid imagination allows faster
and easier tulpa creation,
however 'hallucinating' an image
isn't a concrete requirement,
with 'idol objects' or 'focusing pictures'
sufficient to start thoughtform
 even if host has no imagination
 (aphantasia and various mental
 limitations), in Buddhism
 such object( kasina) is used 
 as mental template for
 numerous purposes aside from
 creation of tulpas.
 

2.Focusing: repetition and retrival
of shape from memory, focusing
on the entity in trance-state
and visual meditation.
At this stage a stable mental
image or reference starts
appearing without focus during
 meditative/trance states 
 as mental space(memory palace)
 object.
 

3.Interaction: object is 
 fed attention and personal traits
 imagined by tulpamancer.
It features, qualities are 
shaped and introduced to increase
 complexity and realism.


4.Imaginary dialogue:
object is given a name and addressed
 as 'voice' within the mind.
Thoughform is treated as having
its own opinions and imaginary
persona that is 'forced' into it,
(the later tulpa will change
to more optimal form)

4a.'internal Voices':
Tulpa from mental
dialogues alone can be created
in some cases, though without
shape they will stay as 'voices',
leading to mental illness as
tulpa will want energy/attention
it could only attain within dialogue
 which logically leads to constant
  'dialogue'(initiated by tulpa)
  battling for 
  attention(mental energy) and 
  eventual takeover of tulpa by
  some external entity as its
  form and tulpa-persona merge.
  
4b.Servitor program: 
object is given rigid script to
follow and willed into action,
Repetition and reward serve 
as primary methods, however 
 servitors will eventually
 form tulpas if not dismissed
 and dismantled in mind.
 
4c.internal servitor. 
Servitors can be used to 
perform a tasks by host
using his own body,
a primitive automation 
type servitor that is described as 
'learned reflexes/muscle memory'
used in fields from chess to
 touch-typing - this type is 
 often created involuntary 
 with simple training repetition 
 to unconsciously perform a task:
 the mind is filled with thousands
 of such primitive servitors 
 who attach to mental body.

4d.Wonderland object:
A servitor-type entity for 
interactive wonderlands:
it will achieve some degree
of sentience with time.



5.Separation/Reification :thoughtform is given
autonomy and space(wonderland) or
specific task(servitors) to perform.

5a.Switching: Tulpa stays close
to host mind, with host switching 
its consciousness into tulpa mind
and tulpa gaining control of 
mental body.

5b.Possession: Tulpas grow
powerful enough to impose its
will on the host as mental body
 is taken over(usually temporary)
 for feeding on chakra energy 
 without host focus.
