Advanced servitors can be 
created for any mental task 
to be outsourced with sufficient
 effort: abstractification,
 dissociation and
 automation of many activities
 to a network of servitors 
 actually occurs in most people,
as consciously performing drains
too much energy.

Risks:
Servitors can take a central
place in mind, voicing and generating
 thoughts from spirit's pre-formed
  intentions and even replace
  most of mindstream with automated
mental loops(npc scripts) if host dissociate
 hard enough(due e.g. trauma).
