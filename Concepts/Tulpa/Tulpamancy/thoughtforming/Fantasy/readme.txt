Fantasy is an undeveloped
 tulpa wonderland, like a
  servitor is a limited tulpa
  gaining sentience with time,
the 'fantasy' transforms into
more detailed, independent and
complex mental object, eventually
gaining own tulpas(mental actor tulpa).

Fantasies are especially potent
due gaining massive energies
from host's desires, as the host
gains mental satisfaction/comfort/escapist dissociative states
from fantasy-forming activities.
