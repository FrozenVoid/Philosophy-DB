Tulpamancy is modern magical
 school that broadly resembles
Summoning as art:
The risks of tulpa creation
are poorly understood and 
dismissed as 'mental illness'.

Tulpamancy is more accessible
to general public and requires
little preparation. Rituals
and protective techniques are
ignored in favor of bruteforce
 methods.
 Tulpamancy focuses on inter-personal
  relations and emotional support,
  as opposed to using tulpa 
  for gaining knowledge/explore mental plane.
