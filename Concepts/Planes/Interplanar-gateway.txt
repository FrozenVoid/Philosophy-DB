An interplanar gateway(portal, stargate, interdimensional tunnel) is 
a region of space-time which passes though different planes:
The gateway can end within the same plane or connect different planes,
 but its fabric will always extend outside the host plane(interdimensional structure).
A gateway that is bound to a physical artefact is a 'stargate',
while the one which is embedded in space-time fabric is a 'wormhole'.
A 'portal' is a temporary gateway that depends on external source of energy to function:
a gateway is usually static, but portals can move and expand, as directed by 
 the energy manipulation that feeds the gateway fabric.
