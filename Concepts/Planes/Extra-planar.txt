Some plane/entity that is beyond the planes(of a local system),
can be either linked or unlinked to non-physical planes.
(In some cases entities can form their own planes, 
like a private pocket dimension linked to the entity chakras)

Unlinked planes(not connected vertically/horizontally):
The term is a placeholder to identify planes not connected
to our physical plane in any form, through not prevented from
projection by a physical entity
(spiritual planes can have this property).

Alien planes(horizontally linked, parallel planes):
In reference to entities/realms not bound within 
a system linked to physical plane(vertically connected),
but linked to common(local system) 
 etheric/astral/mental/causal planes, with
 their system linked to ours horizontally, so a term of "alien planes"
 also is used to differentiate from the local plane-system
(parallel worlds/realms connected and bound to our physical plane  that abide
by common laws and share same energy).

Examples to illustrate:
A realm that shares a physical plane is a mundane parallel world.
A realm that shares an astral plane but does not share a physical plane is on an alien plane(etheric plane sharing is close to parallel worlds due etheric being highly material).
A realm that only shares mental or above planes with us is "weakly-linked" planes.
A realm that doesn't share any planes is on unlinked plane.
