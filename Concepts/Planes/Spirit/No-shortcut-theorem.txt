The idea that one cannot skip
 development of lower chakra/planes
 in favor of highest possible.
The problem is incomptability
between the current and desired
 plane will ruin 'gradual ascent/progress'
with incompatible standards and
 existence of desire:
 Specificially Sacral chakra
  over Root chakra in Material plane.
Sexual desires of Sacral chakra
 will stop higher chakra development
which reminds one to develop
 and purify Sacral chakra.
