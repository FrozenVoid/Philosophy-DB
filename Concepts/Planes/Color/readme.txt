Each realm and plane has its
own 'color'(vibration sequence),
with lower planes having 
simple(single-color freq) colors and
higher planes having complex,
rich colors(most of which cannot
be correlated to visible spectrum
and not monochrome in detail,
e.g. fractal pattern).

These colors also have a counterpart
in sound, with specific 
binaural frequencies aiding
 etheric body to attune to the 
 specific plane "frequency combination".
