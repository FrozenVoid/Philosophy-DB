Density of a plane is its ratio of energy
vs structure: high-structure planes are
more material/solid/stable, high-energy planes
are more chaotic/abstract/field-like.
A low-density plane doesn't make existence
inside it automatically more comfortable,
but reduces material suffering aspects of
existence with lesser structure-form reliance:
the form follows energy/thought/emotion in a more
straight path vs structure-centric form planes.
Formless planes have no structure at all,
with "forms" dictated by energy configurations
and dynamic conditions of environament:
particles clouds act like abstract 
low-density fields in such planes.
