A tulpa insertion is a form of summoning an entity
into an existing living being: this process is responsible
to language, culture and "common sense" at large scale,
where cultural egregores spawn tulpas
(usually with aid of humans and devices) into new humans,
animals and thoughtforms developing.

As entity tulpaforces an thoughtform inside a living being,
where the expected persona of this tulpa's target
is rewarded with energy
and other manifestations of living being are supressed
like an artificial personality taking over.

Hypnosis, brainwashing and psychological pressure are
all facets of same thing: summoning/drawing forth
a specific tulpa that
is socially integrated into a situation, overwritinng the personality
/soul/mind in order to create a 'learned identity'.

A domesticated animal(or a human baby) develops this tulpa over 
human interactions to integrate cultural beliefs/expectactions
of the nearby humans to create a persona, which is ultimately
a fake act that takes over the mind(ego-formation) to perform
in society - a 'learned role' in play of cultural egregores.
