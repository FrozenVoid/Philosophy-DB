Perception of perceptions from
an external frame of mind, meta-perception,
is the psychological basis for
expirience of consciousness as
a process,as opposed to direct
perception-reaction loop.

Types:
Self-awareness is a 
 meta-perception of senses as 
  perceptions within the body
 currently inhabited.

Introspection is a meta-perception
of the mindstream, allowing 
analysis of thoughts and sense data
as discrete packets of information.

Recognition is a form of 
meta-perception that melds 
all perceptions of a subject and
its associated memories/patterns 
in development of analytic examination.
e.g. idea formation from analogy
and repetition->
category/property/quality->
recognition of subject as related.
