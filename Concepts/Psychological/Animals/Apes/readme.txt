Apes,Monkeys and Great Apes in particular
occupy a prominent position in public consciousness.
Some activist groups even argue that they
should be granted human rights as as closest 
human relative on the planet.

Psychologically, a human concept of 'a monkey'
is linked with understanding of species:
we have delineated the animals into concrete
categories - given specific traits and sets
of stereotypes, the monkeys however appear 
 closer to humans with human-like traits
 and emotional capacity to represent a human.
This category delineation of 'human species'
has to acknowledge that in some ancient past
 the 'humans' were a type of monkey, a
 common ancestor to apes and humans.
Under lens of history, a monkey is a
'primitive humanoid' that refused to 'evolve'
instead stagnating in ecological niche that 
appears similar to condition of early human
ancestors - the default state of feral children
sans human support. An ape represents this regression
 to natural order and contrasts the civilized 
 world defining humanity as distinct from
 'feral apes' that 'feral children' would devolve
 to without the cultural component of civilization.
