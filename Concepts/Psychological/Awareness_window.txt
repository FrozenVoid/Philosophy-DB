Scope of conscious focus,
perceptions that are focused on
can be extremely narrow excluding
background(missing general features)
or extremely broad unfocused
 perception of a scene(missing detail),
 single sense focus(e.g. concentration 
 on hearing clearly) or ignoring
by relevancy(higher-level awareness filters)
