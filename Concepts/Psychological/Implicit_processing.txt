Unconscious/Semi-consciouss processing
of perception that is not inside 
 the window of awareness, largely
 immune from introspection as the
 scope of introspection requires
 discrete abstract categories of
 high-level/meta perception while
 implicit processing is more similar
 to reactive neural networks.
