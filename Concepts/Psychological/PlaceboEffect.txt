the 'Placebo effect' is upper chakra(crown/above crown, third eye)
focused mental energy that
is shaped by a belief system; Placebo is essentially
'faith in effect', that is belief reconfiguring the energetic pathways 
towards an expected outcome, like a mantra repetition aligns the 
subtle bodies in specific configuration: the expectation of future
will shape the reality on mental/causal planes.

Reality-shaping beliefs are capable of altering entire timelines 
if sufficient energy is set in motion, however such beliefs
 will clash with other people flows of focused mental energy 
 and will alter the timelines in some sort of 'averaging normalisation'
 of all beliefs and fantasies coming to the surface.
