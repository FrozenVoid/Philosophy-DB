A mindstream focused on specific subject/pattern/object
will change its internal character
to adapt the flow of consciousness that
is usually changing to different targets 
into a Focused Flow of awareness, where
some central object is repeatedly referenced,
recalled and examined. This limited channel
is then viewed from a higher level
of abstraction(introspection), as the simplicity
of stream of consciousness allows easier
examination of its nature and effects.
This 'concentration on simple pattern/object'
also allows to allocate mental resources 
elsewhere (`keeping the mind monkey busy`)
whereas the deep consciousness of the observer
can now operate with more freedom vs 
chaotic, rich real-world environment that is
normal for daily awareness.
