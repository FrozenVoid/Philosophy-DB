Unknown is something that is both novel and lacks analogues
to explain it(unidentified, alien, foreign, mysterious).

The expirience of unknown is acquisition of knowledge,
with gnosis(direct knowing) being a purely mental knowledge induction.
Unknown is psychologically intimidating due personal
 worldviews, instinct and expirience: as unknown expirience 
 is understood it loses its 'fear factor'(regardless of its actual
 threat level), reducing its threat spectrum and removing fear.

Positions:
Science is explaining the unknown in terms of already known,
building up the categories,logic systems and definitions to create a reality model
that is logically consistent and verifiable.
Unknown is viewed as surreal, unrealistic and bizzare.

Religion is explaining the unknown in terms of esoteric abstractions,
building up an abstraction system to systematize esoteric knowledge
 to present a more familiar reality that is realistic.
Unknown is viewed as foreign, demonic, alien and supernatural.
