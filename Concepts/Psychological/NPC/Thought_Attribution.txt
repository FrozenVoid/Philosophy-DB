A NPC would treat every thought, voice or image
in their mind as originating from 'self',
i.e. all thoughts are 100% their own or
originate from own memory,
which creates implicit trust in mind processes
which build on these "organic thoughts".
Example:
NPC gets thought A and builds thought B
without doubting/examining A in depth,
as if automatic reasoning machine was 
presented with Input /A,B/.

The idea that A could be implanted in memory
(e.g. by background listening to advertising)
and not originate within 'self' would
be a psychologically hard to construct vs
instinctive 'recall' of a thought A:
this seed A thought then is used to construct
a mental pattern (which often instinctively
brought from associative memory) to lauch
a mental process 
A->{reflexive-associative:B=>C=>D} which hijack
willpower(as B=>C=>D part is now truly
originating from within the NPC mind:
self-attribution at this point is definite) to
perform the induced mental action - multiplied
by hundreds of background influences and
 marginal information sources(e.g. gossip)
 this creates a field of mental loops, autonomously
generating new mental processes from
few seeds. A persona grows dependent on 
these loops and since NPC gains social approval
 from exhibiting mental loop patterns of a group
 the field is entrenched in mind by imitation.

The process of enculturation is never stopped
in NPC, the 'open-minded' mentality accepts
socially enforced paradigms/rules/zeitgeists as
unquestionable price of in-group role,
automatically updating 'correct position'
 or 'the party line' via the process of forming
 the mental loops described above: the weakness
 of 'following the crowds' is masked by constant
  reinforcement and reflexive-associative reactions
  to information feeds(social media, news feeds).
