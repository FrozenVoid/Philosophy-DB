Introspection denial is activity
of active supression/substitution
 of introspection by a person, 
 who might find it discomforting
to introspect: this creates 
an external focus in mindstream,
which shifts the egocentric defaults
towards group identities and affiliations,
the mind adapts to insert introspective
 mental constructs as external
 judgement - this is exploited
by non-physical entities to control
the mind as people believe in 
external locus of control(fate,gods)
without critically analyzing their
 thought process, letting it 
 "go with the flow" which is a
 recipe for building reactive
 mental patterns/scripts that a 
 person cannot untangle without
 introspection, which he rejects
due discomfort.
