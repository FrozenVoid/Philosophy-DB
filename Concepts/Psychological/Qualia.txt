Character of subjective perception/meta-perception
that is shaded by expirience,
state and structure
of the mind, as opposed to general
characteristics that are sensed
mechanically and can be captured
by a device or written down.
Associations, implicit processing,
mental frameworks and emotional 
judgements act
 together to create a unique
 expirience of a perception for
 each person(e.g. color red).
