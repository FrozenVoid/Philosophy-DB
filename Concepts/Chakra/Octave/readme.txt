Octave (or chakra line) is a set of frequencies
from below-foot(earth) chakras to above-crown(star/spirit chakras),
represented as block of frequencies(which also correspond
to planes where the chakras manifests).

Chakras,planes, entities resonate with multiple octave
of EM/Sound/Vibration frequencies where they manifest
qualities of that octave from 0hz(universal ground state)
to infinity Hz vibrations, as unique planar connections
(e.g. theta brainwaves
and etheric plane represent the Theta octave,
where each chakra having a frequency in Theta range).
