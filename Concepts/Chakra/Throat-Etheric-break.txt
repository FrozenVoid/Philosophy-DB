Activation of throat chakra on projection state that
 breaks projection/lucid dream, usually
expirienced as dream/projection ending after 4-30 seconds after
 speaking/eating.
 Virtual simulation of speaking/eating as 
 passive observed expirience(autopilot dream) does not cause a break.
 People with weak throat chakras may also avoid dream breaks
 if their throat activity(will application/voice/eating) is low and spaced.
