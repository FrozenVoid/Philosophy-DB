Void chakras exist in intersection of
 five other elements.
 Primary are palm center 
 and feet soles.
Void element is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81
a sixth element, often not mentioned
with most esoteric texts.
Void/Emptiness/Shunyata are
 counter-element of Ether/Space/Form.
 
 Activation of Void element:
 By spreading fingers in hand or feet,
 the void center becomes active,
 satrting to absorb nearby ether 
 like a blackhole or vaccuum cleaner,
 the feeling might resemble contraction
 of matter into the palm,
 this is a stage of ether depletion.
 Continued practice/meditation
 on the element requires a strong
  throat(Ether) chakra.


Similar method:
gesture of Calling the Earth to Witness, used by Buddha is a 
similar method to activate
void element(his fingers are spread somewhat, in activation of palm center only a moderate finger gap is required to initiate the vortex) + grounding the elements(fingers touch down).
