Hell or 'the Abyss' chakras 
are feet(ankle/knee) and lower chakras(under the person) 
that connect to sub-material planes
 below Earth in hierarchy.
These chakras are not included
in most spiritual systems
 and instead root(material plane) is considered
 the 'ground state'
 (instead of The Abyss), to avoid
  focus on the planes connected
  to these chakras.

Purification of these chakras
with mantras(e.g. Hrum) will bring
out karmic debts and residue
 of these planes to surface.

Standing still will activate knee chakra
 by default.
