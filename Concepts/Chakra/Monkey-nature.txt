Biological instincts and entities attached to lower chakras(Soles,Knees,Feet,Root,Sacral) work
in unison to revert human nature back to a basic, primitive state 
comparable to monkeys and feral humans:
the progress of culture, law and civilization 
keeps humans focused on higher chakra activity(Manipura,Heart,Throat)
and some psychical forces(Third eye, Crown) possible be isolation of
 gross violence and brute force in a society.
 The cultural egregores which control social forces however 
 have their own corrupting influence that is keeping humanity
 in unnatural state of 'herd mentality'(required for social cohesion)
 battling monkey instincts, creating an antipathy to civilization:
Hermits, recluses, "lone wolf" mentality and desire for isolation
is the outcome of psychological damage from egregores enforcing 
a 'social contract', however a prolonged disconnection from civilization
creates a reversal towards feral human 'monkey nature' with which
most people cannot adapt - the person loses social skills and human
qualities enculturated by society in favor of intuition and instinct.
