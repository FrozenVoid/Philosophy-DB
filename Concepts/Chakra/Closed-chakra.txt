A chakra can be closed, due damage, energetic configuration
or lack of energy
sufficient for its function. A person who has a closed
chakra exhibits deficiencies in functions linked to
that chakra location/element, which may cause mental disorders
and hormonal disbalance.
Symptoms: the area where chakra is located is sensed
as 'cold/distant' non-self, with energy in the area
not moving or absent entirely:e.g. leg/knee/ankle chakras.

Intentional closing: a person is capable of
'shutting down' chakras to conserve elemental energy
or to evade attack from astral parasites/predators(e.g. 
on sub-conscious level).

Temporary opening: during sleep, astral projection and
 meditation such closed chakras can be forcefully opened,
 but this usually results in further damage, since
 chakras and theor channels need to be healed first.
