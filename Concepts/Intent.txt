Intent is a future belief in change that the person
applies to the present, a category of thought-forming techniques.
Any intent also carries its own karmic fruits:
i.e. intent alone attracts new karma, just like a fantasy links one
with worlds compatible with it so does intent alone.
Intent is more powerful with higher planes as thought is actualized
much faster, fuller and more complete: mental and higher planes
 intent shapes reality directly as application of free will.
