Some that is beyond the planes(of a local system),
can be either linked or unlinked to non-physical planes.

Unlinked planes(not connected vertically/horizontally):
The term is a placeholder to identify planes not connected
to our physical plane in any form, through not prevented from
projection by a physical entity
(spiritual planes can have this property).

Alien planes(horizontally linked, parallel planes):
In reference to entities/realms not bound within 
a system linked to physical plane(vertically connected),
but linked to common(local system) 
 etheric/astral/mental/causal planes a term of "alien planes"
 also is used to differentiate from the local plane-system.
