Religion is 'socialized spirituality' controlled by state-like structure
that uses spirituality to direct social forces/reforms towards
specific state conductive to success of 
the egregore of religious organization power(the same thing powers 
most ideologies and philosophical schools(e.g. atheism)) over competing entities.
Most humans don't have expirience with direct spirituality,
only a limited version("belief system" transplant)
that they get from religious authority,
philosophical literature or ideological clique.
