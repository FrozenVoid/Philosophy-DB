Problem of Evil is created when a strawman Super-Omni-Ultra God
is contrasted with low-quality physical realm he supposedly created.
The idea that God(s) are omni-anything and being part of the 
system they created themself is absurd on numerous points:
the system that contains a God isn't driven by its part, at best
it resembles king and the land arrangement, with numerous factions striving
for power over lesser beings: the idea of conflict between an
 Omni-God and something lesser is absurd.
The properties of God(s) in various books don't seem to be on the 
upper end of the cosmic power scale, 
where humans/demons/spirits can challenge
them in some aspect: there is no hint of omnipotence or omniscience.

The buddhists put gods on lower end Brahma plane and paint gods(Brahmas)
as limited and egocentric,
where the state of mind is just above 'desire realm'.
A solution to 'problem of evil' with redefining evil as absence
of God is just philosophical trick that still doesn't answer
the problem with omnipotent God allowing 'absence of God' to occur
and have conflict with evil which he allows himself.
