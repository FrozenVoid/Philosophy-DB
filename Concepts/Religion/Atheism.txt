Atheism is an example of religio-social movement that
doesn't depend on hierarchy, but is reliant on philosophical
literature and mutual support networks/organizations, which
in turn have their own hierarchies, leaders and 'prophets':
this is typical for ideologies and philosophical schools
that operate on field of spirituality without presenting
a spiritual worldview: materialist philosophy and economic theory,
can replace spiritual focus of a human being by redirecting
refined/spiritual emotion towards
greed,envy,pride ultimately cultivating sense of injustice used
by such systems to hide
 underlying spiritual reality with sophistry and denial:
 usually such systems justify their hierarchies as
 natural needs and 'scientific efficiency' to subjugate
 their adherents into economy-centric enterprises, where
 material labor is treated as highest achievement of human being.
