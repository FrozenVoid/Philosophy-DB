Hierarchy and delegation of power is endemic to religion
and relio-social movements: the 'Great chain of being' where
Supreme Leader(usually depicted as omnipotent and omniscient being)
delegates power to high-level party, which in turn delegates power
to mid-level managers and low-level enforcers
of the Supreme Leader will:
Usually all transgressions of lower levels are justified
as part of Supreme Leader's plan or interference by traitors/enemies.
This scheme is applied to entire view of 
religion, from its highest spiritual/cosmological concepts to
lowest social schemes it promotes.
The religion cannot accept forces operating outside of
spiritual hierarchy, instead describing them as
either traitors/enemies, rarely deviating from binary us/them thinking
and reducing complexity to black/white morality of strict dualism
at every level.

Note:North Korea is probably a bad model for spiritual hierarchy,
but its structure and level of control is most similar:
there is tendency to most religions to expect retributive systems,
rather than corrective measures
(which would correspond to non-hierarchical spiritual beliefs,
such as e.g. karma being a natural path of being, 
rather than its sentence/fate/sin 
to be enacted/redeemed by entities entrusted with control)).
