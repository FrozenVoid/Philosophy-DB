Walking is the basic form of movement for humans.
This article investigates 'How humans walk' and their common mistakes(anti-patterns, humans are not 'perfect walkers' despite such specialization):
Proper walking is ensured by keeping awareness of terrain shape and ground objects to avoid losing balance.
Walking is considered one of most energy-efficient(unaided by tools/vehicles) forms of movement and lacks health risks(if properly conducted).
Common mistakes/anti-patterns in walking:
1.Marching movement, pressing the ground. This wastes energy on unelastic collisions with terrain.
2.Forward lean: leaning the body in direction of walking, this decreases balance.
3.Side lean: leaning the body towards the direction of front leg, this wastes energy.
4.Uneven step: using one leg with larger steps and other with smaller, this decreases balance and may use energy suboptimally due side leaning #3 or using one leg too much as basis of movement.(It is benefical in case of leg injury to avoid straining one leg.)
5.Alternating between Fast Walking and Walking: transitions betwen two modes of walking may reduce balance during transition.
6.Idle hand movement during walking: Reduces balance and causes minor leaning towards/opposite direction of hand movement(as unconscious balance compensation). In Fast Walking this might help if hand movement is synchronized with leg movement to actually increase balance, but increase energy use.
7.Walking direction drift: changing direction towards right/left in forward walking wastes energy and increase distance travelled. Usually used to avoid obstacles instead of skipping/stepping over them.
8.Walking on uneven terrain: avoiding uneven terrain as much as possible to reduce vertical movement(which wastes energy) and chances of slipping/falling due loss of balance.
For exercise, uneven terrain is unsuitable due balance issues which may cause injury. Walking by steps/ascent is advised instead.
9.Using footwear with too much cushion: this masks the pathological gait patterns that causes injury long-term(e.g. not feeling the entire foot and using the foot as stump to strike the ground).Running amplifies such pathological gaits.
10.Neck lean: Keeping your head scanning ground objects may cause neck lean downwards and subsequently neck pain due strain of supporting the head in such lean.
11.Walking on the sunny side: Its generally brighter but UV radiation and increased temperature are less healthy. Walking in the shadow reduces perspiration due more effective cooling and reduces UV radiation absorbtion. Temperature differences are minor in most cases and don't justify walking on the sunny side, in addition staring at bright objects and sun reflection will reduce peripheral awareness of less bright/distant objects.
12.Walking through yellow/red lights: People usually justify that with "no cars on red lights = free to go", but this is a traffic law: a car can turn up at any moment and pass since on their side its Green light - they are assumming others respect the traffic laws and may not notice you skipping through the road. Gambling with your life on saving a dozen seconds is not worth it. Wait for Green light and always check for turning cars from side directions.
13.Not using pedestrian bridges/passages designed to avoid cars entirely. This significantly reduces risk of accidents due not being on the same path as any vehicles(excluding bicycles/scooters).
14.Walking too close to walls/barriers: in addition to risk of collision with walls/barriers(esp. head collision on turning/falling), walking close to walls/barriers reduces freedom of movement significantly and requires constant awareness of barrier distance to walk.
15.Keeping attention on internal thoughts/mobile devices/electronic displays/external factors. This reduces awareness of ground and terrain conditions which increases risk of accidents significantly. Walking is not a simple leg movement it is a consious activity, requiring awareness of surroundings.
16.Walking opposite of wind direction: reduces speed and exposes one to wind chill, which amplifies temperature.
If the wind is strong enough, pick paths with high wind resistance(trees, walls, barriers, etc objects blocking wind).
If walking directly into the strong wind, change direction to an angle which exposes you to less wind - about 40 degrees left/right will reduce wind chill/rain falling in front of face(which is the primary source of cold/wind exposure).
17.Walking on wet surfaces: increases risk of slipping/falling significantly, espectially in Fast Walking mode.
18.Walking on narrow paths: Reduces freedom of movement and increases chances of accidents when stepping off path.
19.Walking on elevated terrain/objects: this introduces major risk of falling towards lower elevation, pick the low-elevation path if possible.
20.Walking on non-terrain objects such as wood frames/planks/logs: requires awareness of object balance and increases risk of accidents due object movement. Terrain is much safer.
21.Walking over fresh cement/asphalt/etc: exposes one to dangerous chemicals and ruins footwear. Avoid paths with major road construction projects if possible.
22.Not resting during long walks: Walking requires rest periods due energy strain on muscles. Resting allows repair and refueling of muscle system.
