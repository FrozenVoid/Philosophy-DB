In Theseus brain scenario,
the replacement of cells with
biocompatible hardware is treated
as uniform, completely equal exchange.

However looking at it from
non-material perspective the
physical neurons have an etheric,
astral and mental counterparts
which the new hardware will lack.
Instead of replacement the 
space for these subtle body
counterparts will just shrink 
as the hardware area is purely
dead matter. The solution to
this Theseus brain is merely
copying the physical neural 
network(a mechanical replication
and replacement), which is equivalent
to cyborgization or artificial
brain implant gradually replacing
the biological brain.

At best it would be
a haunted computer with a soul(
subtle body complex) stuck inside
without a means to control it.
