Theseus Brain is brain being replaced part by part like Theseus Ship.
The process presents important insights on existential quality of 'self'
and 'mind' vs the materialist notion that mind is part of body.

 All your neurons/dendrites/astrocytes/etc are replaced one by one with artificial biocompatible cells(with same presumed configuration). Consiousness isn't interrupted.

Now imagine there is an artificial copy of your brain(that has a different consciousness), that is receiving the opposite treatment:
It receives all the "replaced" cells from the original brain.
Will those two brain be identical consciousness or preserve their own original forms(the new artificial brain with original mind + new biological brain with artificial consciousness ) or they will be molded into their substrate's neural  patterns(materially-constrained consciusness - equivalent to brain damage)?

The non-materialist answer is that mind is contained within mental body and it stays with the body location, so the artificial brain has to interface with a mental body.
The materialist however has to account to the possibility that biological brain's mind has been cloned into another substrate by theseus-type transfer.
