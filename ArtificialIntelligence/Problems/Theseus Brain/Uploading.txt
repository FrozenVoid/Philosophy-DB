Theseus Brain circuits could be losslessly
transferred to another machine by gradual 
 merging of a TB with a wall-type interface to
  a network, "absorbing" and transfering circuits
 as Theseus Upload diffuses the mind into machine.
Soul, if it still remains will likely detach 
as fields binding it to brain circuits are 
moved apart.
