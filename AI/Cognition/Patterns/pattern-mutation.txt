A test if recognized pattern will be valid with mutated parameters:
determine the parameter space of pattern: is it narrow/wide?
Can the pattern mutate into another via parameter change?
What changes in a pattern make it invalid?
What parameters are critical and which are superflous/marginal?

The flexibility in creative interpretation depend
on such pattern mutation: from memes to discovering
new formulas, the idea is to alter-and-test
succesful pattern to obtain new ones.
