A cognitive loop is a background process
that spawn other processes as necessary,
usually responding to inputs as they
 appear and change the program state:
 a cognitive loop is the "orchestra conductor" that
 switches to specific state and alters
 its responses to input independent of input(
 i.e. it does not require input to act).
 
Most current AIs are static pattern
recognizers that lack a cognitive loop
and cannot 'branch' or 'specialize' dependent
on input: their responses are static
sequence of same format as their state
is completely input-driven by design.
