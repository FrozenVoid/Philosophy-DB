A narrow intelligence is a specialized intelligence that 
is limited to function in concept-space of its domain.
An AI that is general purpose has to adapt to multiple domains;
that requires either modular(separate component with domain-specific knowledge/training) or generic intelligence(much more complex to adapt/develop).
Generic intelligence('wide-spectrum intelligence' vs narrow-domain intelligence)
requires a fluid mindspace accomodating radically different reality models:
for a single neural network its impossible to adapt to different reality models,
so such a network would model the overarching 'reality model' of entire world(
as opposed to narrow domain 'reality models' of video games) to include everything.
As such approach requires planning it will require simulating  the world-space
inside the AI to perform any search/optimization techniques, which implies
 computation resources not available in current technological level,
forcing the AI to use a simplified model of real world.
Such a simplified 'world reality model' unlike complete-knowledge of 'video-game 
reality model' will underperform with complex, novel data:
the AI will have to learn from incomplete/vague/conflicting data possibly
 from adversary sources to be a generic intelligence.
