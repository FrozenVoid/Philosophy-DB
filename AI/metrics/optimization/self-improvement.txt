Self-improvement is capability
 spectrum of AIs that can 
 apply  "functional optimization"
 towards their own structure,
 contrasted with static AIs that
can only optimize their dataset.

Paths to self-improvement:
1.Moving static code to data
 structures defining control
 flow.
2.Turning external parameters to variables
 accesible to optimization.
3.Dynamic components instead
of static structures: 
e.g. components that are 
added/removed as needed
