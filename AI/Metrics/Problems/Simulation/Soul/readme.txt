An emulation of human being requires artificial chakras to be seen as not "soulless"
A robot or VR construct is usually a material sense object.
Approaches:
1. Sound emmission to replicate vibrations of chakras.
2. Stones: Energy of various stones can simulate chakra channels.
3. EM wave emmission: EM radiation can replicate fields/auras of chakras.
4. Artificial tulpa/servitor insertion: if AI evolves to operates on astral energy fields.
5. Aura replay: Replay loop of recorded human auras.
6. Bio-active organic component:
robots can store artificially created organic tissue in place of chakras. engineered to 
 emulate human organs(e.g. liver).
