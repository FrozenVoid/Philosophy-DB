Modular AI design would segregate functionality into modules,
instead of employing monolithic one-size-fits-all approach.
architecture example from bottom-up:
1.Function-level module: small sub-modules that are 
optimized to perform/score better by using machine learning.
2.Module block: a conglomerate of functions, parameters and networks.
3.Meta-module: a component controlling other modules.
4.Module generator: a component which creates new modules.
