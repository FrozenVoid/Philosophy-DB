AI government is a government structure that is controlled by AI;
Precursors;
the idea of benign philosopher-king is found in the works of Plato,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_king which can be understood 
as the analogy to a framework in which AI can be a neutral arbitrator in enforcing 
a set of laws and regulations.

General features;
1.Immunity to political bias:AI would not 'takes sides' but will calculate
the 'right decision' per-case.
2.Big-data picture: AI would have the 'complete picture' of any problem.
3.Speed: AI would be able to function much faster than a human-based government.
4.Sensitivity:AI would easily detect political/social problems before human-based governments
would even acknowledge their existence.
5.Intelligence:A (superintelligent) AI would by definition be smarter than
any human politician or bureaucrat.
6.Zero corruption:superintelligent AI will not be bribed or pressured by
by human-interest values. 

Problems: by-the-letter enforcement of laws/rules. 
Resistance to reforms/amendement
of law/rules. Low context sensitivity(AI expirience lacks emotion)
