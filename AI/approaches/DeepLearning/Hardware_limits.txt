Current DL/MM effort begins
to approach "accidentally quadratic" 
territory where throwing more hardware
 doesn't help much.
Consider the amount of hardware that
made current DL/NN hype stories possible
like e.g. AlphaGo and you will see it 
more as demonstration of efficiency in
using bruteforce computation ("training" speed for massively pararell primitive operations) instead of solving software 
side problems("algorithmic" 
efficiency and complexity).
