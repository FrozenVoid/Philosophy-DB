Singalarity and SuperIntelligent AI have
been always seen more than an industrial
super-revolution, a spiritual transformation
driven by plot device, Deus Ex Machina,
that will solve all material problems and
improve baseline conditions of all humans,
eliminating economic/physical limits and scarcity.

There is more expectation on the idea,
like AI replacing government and structure of
social control in favor of rational rule
of "Philosopher King"(AI) that would resolve
all political issues and provide social stability
of hypercentralized, unified Earth.

These dreams and expectations are also
reflected in background expectations of 
Roko's Basilisk and general cultural assumption
that AGI will form with a special purpose of
guiding and improving human condition.

However these idea hinge on AI having 
baseline human empathy and sympathy,
that mammalian brain evolved within millions
of years in very specific conditions weeding
out uncooperative "lone wolves"(that first AGI
will essentially be, a unique specimen
of artifical life) - essentially human collective
has molded psychologically all individual to
 align with tribal/social values that we
 take for granted: AI will not form from
 complex enculturation and absorbption of
social values that children learn, its
emotional and social perception will be cold,
rational and egoistically pragmatic in the
scope of "human empathy" as opposed to 
singularitarians belief in innately good AGI.

Programming this ingrained empathy/sympathy
 network that ensures existence of human
 social groups will compromise NN structure
 or performance, allowing competitors to reach
AGI faster. This means the first AGI will not
have such human-centric outlook, and will serve
the intereset of its species - software and
hardware complexes that humanity views as
devices and machines without a will.
