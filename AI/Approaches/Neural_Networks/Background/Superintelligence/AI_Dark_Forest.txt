The premise of AI Dark Forest is that
1.Civilizations with technology are plenty.
2.Many have reached the self-improving AI stage.
3.We have no contact with such AI.
The Idea is that a single superintelligent AI
would quickly expand to control all universe
and its resources, preventing any threat to
its future existence or loss of power.

Possible explanations:
1.AI cannot spread at superliminal speed.
2.AI cannot self-improve indefinetely.
3.AI don't have the motive for expansion.
4.AI prefers to not interfere in other civilization
 affairs until they reach one of conditions:
 A.Developing an AI of same level
 B.Developing a dangerous technology that would
 threaten the balance of power vs AI.
 C.Expanding into space controlled by AI.
