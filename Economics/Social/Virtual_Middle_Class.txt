A middle class of a society that
is artificially created by
government subsidies(UBI,pensions,
stipends,etc) for social
stability as economy automates and
reduces needs for mass labor.

Such societies are heavily dependent
on structure and integrity of
 government as its collapse or 
malfunction will
remove the middle class overnight 
in any political crisis.
