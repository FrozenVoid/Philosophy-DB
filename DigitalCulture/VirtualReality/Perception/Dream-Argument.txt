A virtual reality that engages the same brain circuits
as dreaming process does would allow the same fidelity
and realism as lucid dreaming does, with minimal investment
 in recreating visual/audio envirment(i.e. dream is stimulated, 
 but not created) to control a 'digital dream process'.
Astral projection likewise could be assisted with digital
means in same manner.
