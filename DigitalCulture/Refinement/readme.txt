Cultural Refinement is a process of specific
 culture/subculture/microculture gradually growing
 in complexity and elegance of styles/ideas/memes
 it contains. As culture grows it aquires
 both positive and negative refinement:
 1.Positive refinement can be broadly seen
 as abstract upgrade to existing cultural content,
 expanding and adding new features/aspects/variations
 that create complexity. Positive refinement 
 by necessity limits the scope of cultural 
 possibility space and guides future cultural
 progress, like a subtree structure spanning out
 of single seed object.
 
 2.Negative refinement is removal and simplification
 of superflous parts/aspects/features that
 lead to greater elegance, expanded cultural possibility 
  space and more natural
 (vs complex/abstract/academic) external appearance for
 cultural outsiders, allowing more diffusion
 and spread as simplification grants flexibility
 to "re-add" missing aspects by local demand,
 i.e. essentially allowing templating towards
  individual cultural needs without compromising
  the cultural stratum on which the individual
  build his own interpretation of a cultural 
  object.
