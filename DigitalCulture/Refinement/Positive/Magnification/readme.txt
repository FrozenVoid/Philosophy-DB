Magnification is a cultural process where
a single aspect/feature/meme/idea gradually
expands in scope and gains extra properties or
 variants where culture reifies its expected
 picture of object(itself a cultural reification
 of concept into concrete implementaion 
 inside the culture) which
 further redefines and limits the object
towards specific cultural configuration.

The base object-concept outside the culture
and inside the culture diverge towards
antagonism as culture and society have different
views(more pronounced in sub/micro cultures)
on what object-concept should mean as culture
places significant importance(via magnification)
to distinguish it from basic concept:
the social-cultural diffusion eventually catches
up and produces various corrupted interpretations
of object-concept from people that have 
vague understanding of cultural context(e.g.
Japanese anime interpreting fairytales) that
further increase magnification as variations
of object-concept diverge from each other,
forcing either redefinition or expansion of concept
("Not a true/real/correct elf"/"Our elves are different").
