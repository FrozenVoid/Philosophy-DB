Categorization is a key driver of positive
refinement inside cultural processes:
the ideas/concepts/memes are classified using
cultural categories which give object-concepts
its place inside cultural context: categorization
essentially builds the structure of cultural
 stratum on which 'cultural contexts' may evolve,
 with categories serving as hierachies of 
 'tagged idea-space' where culture finalizes
 vague tag-like properties into concrete 
 cultural category-space containing the
  tag-descriptor structures which categorization
  organizes from consensus tag-schemes.
  
 Cultural agreement and consensus building over
 categorization in idea-space can split into
 subcultural drift where minority opinions
 gain momentum and create a distinct subculture/
 microculture dedicated to the object-concept
  (e.g. Darth Jar Jar vs mainstream Jar Jar Binks)
