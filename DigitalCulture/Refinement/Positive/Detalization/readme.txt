One of main aspects of positive refinement
is Detalization: cultural
ideas/concept-objects/memes gaining a new level
of detail that was vaguely defined
(stereotypes/assumptions) or incomplete(missing aspects).

Detalization has following aspects:
1.Encapsulation: object-concept properties
are explicitly defined and linked with its 
external appearance in the culture.
The assumed/vague/unclear aspects are reified and
 incorporated into a narrower concept, 
 that object-concept becomes in the cultural context.
 
2.Methodification: object-concept interactions
and functions are explictly linked as internal
and specific to object-concept.
Various inter-object relations are now framed
as modes of object-concept and defined as
 possible or impossible states, as distinct from
  vague concept interactions that can be imagined:
  the culture limits possibility space with
object-concept methods being defined 
and culturally demarcated from its category
 (which cultural detalization further refines on
 another level).

3.Internalization: descriptors, external state
references, names,linked concepts are pulled
into the object-concept category or incorporated
as properties of the object-concept(which
now unlike the initial concept has complex internal
state dependent on current culture definition of
object-concept as part of culture)


In terms of software: the object
 gains new properties that were defined outside
 of it before(encapsulation of detail),
 functionality that was externally controlled
is merged with object itself(methods vs free functions)
and object state is now internally stored
(vs external variables).
