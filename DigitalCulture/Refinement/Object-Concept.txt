The unit of culture that is refined,
object-concepts serve as descriptors to internal
mental states that cultural context evokes.
Fundamentally, the object-concept is an anchor
into specific cultural context state,
an asocciative-category space which contains
this object-concept (e.g. meme inside the culture
vs meme outside the culture).

Example of cultural object-concept:
Inside joke - a joke that has humor value
that only appears inside a specific cultural context,
where a subject has to
1.Be a member of specific cultural group
2.Have a similar cultural outlook(shared cultural context)
3.Have same cultural values(shared values)
to joke be humorous and
not insulting/incomprehensible/juvenile
