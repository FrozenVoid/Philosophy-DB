Culture emerges in following forms

1.Protoculture - basic ideas of cultural significance
 are formed that define future aspects.
 This stage forms in singular event or personal
 expirience that drive emergence of a new
 cultural context and frame of reference.
 (e.g. a person forming a new hobby)

2.Microculture - a cultural group forms around
the core ideas. At this stage, subcultural drift
forms the backbone of popular interpretations that
follow the original context with people joining in.
More popular features draw enough people to
form a small subculture, marginalising esoteric and
 obscure ideas that exist in background.
 (e.g. fans of specific anime)

3.Subculture - multiple groups begin to share
a cultural context which they try to preserve.
Subcultural drift slows down and cliques form
around specific interpretations, creating 
cultural categories and slang for social cohesion,
which allows the subculture to differentiate itself
from broader society.(e.g. Gamers)

4.Culture - society and academia begin to contribute
from broader cultural context. Mainstream acceptance
is rarely achieved, as popcultural osmosis
incorporates most viral features into mainstream
social fabric(e.g. Western culture).
