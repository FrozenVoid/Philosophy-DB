Fan is a microculture member that 
participates in a fandom of specific object-concept:
large fandoms(e.g. Furries) become a fully fledged
subculture. Fans are the broad base on which
microculture spreads and recruits, however
fan-dominated microculture('Fandom') has several
pathological dificiences that allow fans
to be exploited or manipulated.

Fandom is a typical form
of microculture which has few cultural barriers:
microcultures that evolve through adoration
and blind imitation of central object-concept
 will turn into 'fandoms' or 'cults',
 with fans driving 
 the evolution of cultural context.
 
Fans are characterized by uncritical, fanatic
 acceptance and immitation of 
their core object-concept, without much
creative effort or introspection spent over
meta-cultural properties and features of 
object-concept. Culture creators require
 fans for motivation but not for creation,
 and can be indifferent or hostile to 
 'emergent fandom' of their works as the expected
 cultural appeal may draw audience creators
 will disagree with on value model and interpretation
 of shared cultural context.
