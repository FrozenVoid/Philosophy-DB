Idea-seed is a creative inspiration in early
protoculture, where a singular event/person/object
 defines the prototype of emergent design,
 which later forms into protoculture.
 
Emergent design incorporates:
1.distinct style: internalized expirience reified into socio-behavioural model
2.specific mental context: later forms abstract cultural context
3.value model: later forms protoculture measures and categories

Idea-seed can be considered a memetic unit
that encapsulates the minimal protoculture form
in its most primitive development stage:
its mostly vague and incomplete representation
of future design for cultural context which
originators of protoculture will form using
their intepretations of internal expiriences,
the core aspect of which is "imitation of 
imagined cultural style" judged within mental
context of pre-existing culture in which 
originators base their values and judgements.
