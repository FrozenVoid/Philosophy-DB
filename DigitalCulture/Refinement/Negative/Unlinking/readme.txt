Unlinking detaches the object-concept from
its external categories/tags/descriptor,
eliminating some superflous aspects that it
can be 'defined without' and expands into 
possibility space from its concrete
cultural context position.
Unlinking is a gradual process:
1.Detachment: detachment creates differences
between category and object-concept 
membership in it. The seeds of detachment
ironically come from attempts to increase
 detail-space for the object-concept,
 as variants would not threaten the core concept
 as viewed by culture - the object-concept simply
 grows beyond its limiting category.

2.Externalization: internal properties linked
to object-concept category are moved outside
and treated as more optional or stereotypical
 that only weakly defined the object-concept:
 In the broader scope of externalization 
object-concept partly reverts to its basic-social
definition, vague and imprecise but culturally
significant enough to separate from mundane
"dictionary definition".

3.Divorcement: the removal of category and
stereotypical/assumed properties of object
concept. At this stage the link becomes
weak enough the object-concept will undergo
recategorization or break cultural consensus
over its classification.

4.Expansion: object-concept is redefined
as broader supercategory member or spawns
its separate category to refer to new variants
that cannot be contained in it(serving
as "progenitor species" that evolves into
new niches as different but similar creatures)
