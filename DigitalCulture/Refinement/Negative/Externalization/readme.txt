Externalization is a process where
established cultural object-concept diffuses
into broader cultural-context. As object-concept
original cultural context properties are lost,
the broader "social idea" of object-concept
grows divergent variations and subtypes,
which combine into new external category,
that isn't defined by original culture/subculture.

The original culture can backport the 
newer/broder object concept as natural variation
or as parody/critique/sarcastic version that
 would by antagonism redefine the original
 object-concept as different from broader
 social concept, that would serve as prototype
 of another diffusion
 (e.g. "TrueX","TheRealX","ClassicX","TheOriginalX")
