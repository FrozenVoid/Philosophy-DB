Abstractification as cultural process,
is object-concept ascendance into category space,
where properties and attributes of object-concept
 are abstracted into categorical features/aspects,
 as original object-concept continues to 
 serve as Ur-example
 or "progenitor species" that spawned but not
 defined the category itself, which broaden
 possibility on how object-concept can be
 implemented in idea-space.
