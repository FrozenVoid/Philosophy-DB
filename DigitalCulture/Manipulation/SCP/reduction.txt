SCPs are materialist reduction 
of etheric/astral entities into
 semi-material 'monsters'.

The goal of organizing this 
SCP writing seems to fictionalize
 the interdimensional threats like
 X-files does with aliens:
public perception is molded into
accepting a specific interpretation
that is convinient for manipulating
cultural image of entities:
In particular the spiritual/non-physical
 properties are reduced to simplistic
 and easily digested pop culture 'monsters':
i.e. stupid but powerful entities
with no power outside 'monster parks'
that can be jailed in physical domain,
unlike cosmic horror fiction that 
doesn't try to 'power-limit' the entities:
 the site format explicitly tries
 to avoid writing fictional images
 of anything too powerful or too abstract.
 
 There is no practical advice
 in the fictional science:
 e.g. the common vulnerabilities
 of etheric/astral lifeforms
 to metal(e.g. draining ether with steel) are minimized,
 instead relying on complex containment
 /rituals/procedures that create 
 far too many points of failure,
 which is the opposite of security.
