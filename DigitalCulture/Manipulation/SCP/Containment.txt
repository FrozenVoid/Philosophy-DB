The idea of most SCPs is that 
they are "contained" at least 
partly but resist containment
which requires effort or procedure
to establish normality: 
A ritual or a ruleset is often
involved where SCP is sentient,
with rules evolving as SCP interacts
with humans. The core idea
of "Foundation" is maintaining
the illusion of normality for
the "masses" who are blissfully
unaware of lurking dangers and 
depend on "Foundation"(a pretty
 blatant metaphor for government agencies
 in control) to have any social
 stability, a status quo which
rejects "abnormal" phenomenona,
like UFO denial by skeptics and
 official sources: containment
seeks to "deny and coverup" all
evidence of reality straying from
"government-maintained" narrative.
