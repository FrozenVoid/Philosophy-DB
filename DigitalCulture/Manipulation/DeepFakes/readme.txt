Deep Fakes are computer CGI images or film, generated from
pre-trained Neural Networks to copy specific
 style(style transfer) into a realistic frame resembling a human(usually copied over an existing image/video with new features):
 however a close inspection might reveal the image as
 artificially constructed, having artifacts of composition or insertion.
 GAN networks generate images
 that are tested with second "discriminator" network that compares
 the realistic image with actual source data(photography/video) 
 to produce images very close to the real thing.
