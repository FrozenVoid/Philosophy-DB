 Statistics are the 'numerical facts' public
 believes in: broad categories
 of 'things based on statistics'
and 'probability'. This trust
in fabricated reality is the 
core of 'scientific worldview'.
 
Statistics is manipulated as following:

1. Manipulation of 
measured entity definition:
the measured class of objects/
requirement/definition of
 something is altered in favor 
 of another category constructed
 to improve numbers - the common
 device is 'measuring X' by specifying
  X as author intends to.
 
 2.Manipulation of probability:
 the method and means of 
 measuring probability can
 be altered to change outcome.
 
 3.Manipulation of sources:
 pre-selection, filtering,
 pre-requirements/biased
 selection can be used to create
 fake measurements from sources
  supporting the author intent.
 
 4. Alteration of data by hand:
 the numbers themselves are 
 not magically protected if their
 source cannot be traced.
 
 5. Alteration of measuring  domain:
 the subject being measured is
 replaced by similar category
 in the process or changed in
 some way to alter data:
 public is led to believe that
 measuring is done as described.
