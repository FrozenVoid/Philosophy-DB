Melancholy is a set of emotions that are evoked
as subject and mood of song references negative
 emotional states to which listener has empathy
 and associated negative expirience.
Types:
1.Subject melancholy: themes of suffering,
unrequited love, self-criticism and depressive
 realism are common emotional subtext on which
 songs build the melancholic mood-space.
 
2.Melodic melancholy: 
a.widely spaced, high pitched
 tones and patterns of downward sweeps associated
 with gradual disappearance of melody, evoke
 a mood-space where "slowed down" melody gives space
 to self-reflection and melancholic pondering.

b.complex, baroque low-tempo "dark patterns" that associate
with negative emotional states which listener
 imagines to be a reference to his internal
 emotional world.

c.vocal emulation: the melody is set in pattern
that resembles human vocal activity, however
the timbre is "darker" due intrumental coarseness
in imitation of voice frequencies, which evokes
feeling of malaise that links with listener
associative recall.

d.low-frequency sweep: low frequencies(4-25hz)
evoke feeling of awe, triggering emotions
that associate broad object-concepts and the
wider social-cultural context, usually felt
as grandiose pathos of a situation is amplified
and social space is painted as negative, downward
spiral.
