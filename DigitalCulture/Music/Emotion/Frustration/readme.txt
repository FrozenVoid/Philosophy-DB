Frustration occurs where listener mood-space
 is absorbed in self-reflective/self-critical
patterns, where a song provides alternative
social space without the self-reflective/critical
patterns as "escapist fantasy" where listener
finds himself as immersion in song takes hold.
Unlike normal immersion, the listener is 
constantly comparing his real situation to 
fantasy content and expiriences flustration
in his inability to fully immerse in song content.
Flustration and associated emotions of
"escapist mood" create inspiration to change and
motivation to refinement if the listener persists
in identifying object-concepts which the song
creates as "worldview reform" in the listener,
allowing to modify personal worldviews towards
a state more compatible with "song worldview".
