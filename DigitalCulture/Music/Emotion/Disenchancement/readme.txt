Disenchancement occurs when a listener re-evaluates
their alignment in emotional space from
acceptance towards rejection and disgust.
Many songs of lower quality and cultural value
tend to create this emotion, as listener tastes
are refined and greater choice of music
becomes available.
Essentially this emotion reflects that
the quality of song is revealed to be below
the listener standard, even if before the song
evoked positive emotional reinforcement:
repeated listening to a specific song can
expose the flaws and induce powerful Disenchancement.

Types:
1.Melodic dissonance:
listener notices dissonant tones or perceived
flaws that ruins the chord progression or
general flow of song. Repeated or high-volume
listening allows this to be revealed faster

2.Forced rhythm:
the song contains (usually percussive)
rhythms that
 are out of alignment with song mood
 or disturb vocal-melodic immersion.
Instrumental-only version songs tend to expose this
with vocal-based rhythm.
 
3.Lyrical Disenchancement:
song lyrics are out of alignment with
general mood or introduce secodary
associations that reduce immersive flow.
Critical listening and attention to detail
may induce Disenchancement even if emotionally
the song is in tune with listener mood.

4.Vocal timbre:
Singers who sing out of tune or intentionally
parody/mock the content of music by using the wrong
 timbre/pitch or misusing their vocal qualities
 to cover songs out of their genre;
e.g. serious tones where seriousness is unpleasant
and upbeat tone where solemn seriousness is required
