Mixed/Segmented language songs are often
source of common lyrical dissonance where
words inserted from secondary/tertiary language
break phonemic structure of primary language 
song sentences/rhyming,
interrupting flow of mono-lingual parts,
as if breaking song into separate segments,
which reduce passive-immersive emotional appeal,
as most such segment breaks are unpredictable
and force listener to adapt to timing slots.
