Zeal is state of extreme enthusiasm for specific
 subject or state. A song can evoke zeal for
 anything from battles to astronomy.
Zeal internally comes from realization or 
conversion in which immersion is transposed into
listener real-world mental space:
the zeal forms as listener finds immersive qualities
of a mood-space compelling enough outside the
 'fantasy world' created by the song,
providing a path of inspiration
towards a real-world achievement. 
Motivational/epic/trailer music is most 
prone to providing necessary emotional context,
and aggressive lyrics
 set in grandiose cross-cultural settings
 provide fertile ground towards imagining
  heroic/exceptional achievement driven by effort.
