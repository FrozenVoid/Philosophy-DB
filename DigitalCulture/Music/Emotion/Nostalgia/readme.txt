Nostalgia is a complex of emotions that
are generated by associative recall for
specific "social space"(real or imagined)
that the song evokes in its semantic payload.
The person doesn't have to have lived expirience
of historical period or social context referenced:
nostalgic emotions generate a specific mood
context which binds with "social space" associations
that specific historical period evokes,
e.g. "80's cultural space" that has a 
specific emotional subtext that is referenced
by associative recall.

Imagined social space and nostalgia:
music from fictional setting(e.g. The Lords of Rings)
can evoke nostalgic emotions by associations of
what a person imagines the fictional setting
 historical period and social context could be.
The level of detail and complexity of expirience
depends on internal immersion in fictional world
that music evokes: use of narrow, specific 
object-concepts that are unique to the fictional
setting generates greater immersion and 
proportionally greater nostalgia.
