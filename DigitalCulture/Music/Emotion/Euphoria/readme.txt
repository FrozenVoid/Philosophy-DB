Euphoria in context of song emotions defines
a mental state of extreme happiness focused
on specific mood-space: true euphoria is fairly
rare emotion, evoked by especially pleasing
 melody/vocal combination that lack focus:
instead euphoric mood is environmentally driven
with ambient cues and soft emotional subtext,
gradually increasing immersive-associative
alignment within listener mental space(usually
 creating an escapist setting that 'drowns out'
 external circumstances).
 
Immersive-associative
Alignment:
Euphoria require the song mood, subtext and lyrics
to be in complete alignment with listener worldview
and musical preferences, which would create
acceptance of song content and high immersion
state, in which associative-reflective emotions
form in upbeat, optimistic and elegant progression.
IAA occurs only where the immersive qualities
of a song lack negative connotations and 
externally aggressive focus:an upbeat song cannot
enter IAA with lyrics that create unexpected 
associations(e.g. contrary to expected musical
progression/melodical rhythm) and any dissonance
with mental space will trigger "immersion breaks".
