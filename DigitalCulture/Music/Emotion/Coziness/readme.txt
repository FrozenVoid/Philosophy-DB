Coziness is a broad sense of warmth and acceptance
 evoked by song mood. Coziness mental space
 is essentially 'optimistic escapist worldview'
 where all fears and hopes are resolved.
The song genres provide neccesary emotional
 context on which the listener builds associative
  object-concept of 'ideal social space',
 usually referencing a fictional setting where
 real-world concerns cannot materialize and
 where listener lacks duties and obligations,
 creating a sense of uninterruptible comfort.
