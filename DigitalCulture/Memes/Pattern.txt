A meme structure and content are
variable elements that follow
a pattern: recognition of the pattern
as the meme underlying signature,
is the 'meme sense' that alerts
one when memetic content is processed.
This pattern recognition and 
understanding of structure allows
mutation and replication of meme
as species within vague boundaries
 afforded by pattern similarity:
 meme Templates, meme generators,
 image insertions,meme creation
 websites,etc
