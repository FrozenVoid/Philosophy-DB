Image macro is a popular
meme format similar to 
earlier 'propaganda
 posters' with more socially
 appealling content.

A typical image macro consists
of;
1.Central image: evokes some
 emotional state in viewer.
 Bright colors and contrast create
visibility like a movie poster.

2.Top text:opening statement.
usually introducing some popular
 issue or its memetic mutation.
Questions, rhetorical devices and
simple facts can be used to swiftly
 shift the image focus to unrelated
 topic, using the emotional state
 of image-viewer.
The 'macro text' uses 
large fonts used for easy 
recognition.

3.Bottom text:
concluding statement, adds insight
or contrast that appeals to viewer,
usually longer or containing 
a memorable phrase/slogan.

More advanced forms involve:
1.Multiple text windows/lines
superimposed on image, similar
to fanmade comics.

2.Multiple images added
 horizontally/vertically for
 comparing subjects.
 
3.Paired text windows/images,
e.g. galaxy brain memes where
each image in progression gets
its own text window of same size.
