Memes are viral units of digital
culture, its most primitive
component that uses emotional
 alignment and dissonance to spread
 its values. Mainstream culture
 is contrasted with viral,dynamic
  self-reinforcing streams of 
  meme generation that sidestep
  dogmatic categories and formats
 in favor of easy replication/modification.
 
 Memes sacrifice verbosity for
  immediate, instictual recognition
  that is processed emotionally,
  rather than rationally unlike 
 more complex content.
