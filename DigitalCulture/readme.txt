Digital culture is the broad
 domain of Internet-based social
  environments that would not
  exist without cheap internet
  access worldwide.
  
Modern culture is largely digital
 culture and social mainstream
 has changed to 'digital reality'
as basis of 'source authority'
 replacing earlier Television,
 Radio, books, 
 manuscripts and pamphlets.
 
The economies of scale favoring
 low-effort and low-lifespan
 data carriers makes Digital culture
 as ephemeral as its popularity:
Once interest dwindles the remaining
 data sources slowly deteriorate 
 to unreadable state, just like books
 without the resilience of analog
 media.

Data in Digital culture is vast:
Entire terabytes of 'new culture'
are produced daily without much
effort and effortlessly discarded
 by deletion: equivalent to
 building and burning libraries
 occur in lifespan of few moments.
 
Economies of Scale dictate 
mass-production of low-quality data storage
for cheapest access and centralization
of data into 'clouds' of servers and 
 storage devices where public trusts
 its culture, as if 'clouds' were
  neutral public libraries and not
  profit-seeking projects of megacorporations
  eager to exploit all influence from
  the ownership of the central clouds.
