The Chinese ideograms are in fact a large system 
of sigils that have multiple meanings:
their structural meaning(as a sigil) and
literary/slang/abstract reference meaning.
The power of sigils in creating psychological
effect throught unconscious absorbtion is the 
mechanism for their continued survival and
effects - as thousands of these sigils are 
focused daily(charged by) millions of Asian readers,
channelling vast amount of high-level mental
plane energy into fairly dense sigil-field:
unlike alphabetic systems,the word-symbol 
energy of each ideogram is fairly unique vs
letters which are absorbing mutually cancelling
energies and lack mental focus(i.e. a letter
operates on mostly etheric voice channel,
while ideogram embeds itself into mental plane)
