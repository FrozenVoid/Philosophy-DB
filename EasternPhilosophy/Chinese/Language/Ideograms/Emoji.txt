Emoji icons and utility 'unicode symbols' are in
fact close relative to Chinese sigil system,
and their expansion is currently altering
the mental plane: the emoji use gathers
mass astral-emotional energy that is charging
their mental idea-forms in the mental plane
similar popular chinese ideograms(sigils) with
which it competes. Their use in replacing
common words in sentences is creating 
as secondary mental field for alphabetical-based
societies where ideas gain reified sigils.
