Air(Vayu) is connected with expirience of Color(both visual and emotional) and refined emotion, in mental sphere its disciminating intellect and emotional judgement. In chinese 5-element system it corresponds to Metal.
Air dries out physical body due being opposed to Water, as it depletes water: its effects is detrimental on hair and skin(i.e. air-water balance cannot dip high into air territory).
Heart chakra serves as its basis, though its also dependent on water element to function - the interbalance of Air-water axis controls the fluid transport and general health: Air can be used to reduce excess fluidity and infllamation driven by water/fire - serving as healing energy(astral/emotional).
Air channel is opened with letter "E" in mantras. Air is least stable element and is very easy to misuse: control of Air is essentially control of all emotion, supressed Air will eventually burst out via elemental rebound and ether-air synergy.
Air in general has similar effect on Ego as Earth  Element, though while it appears to deplete the Ego, in effect it transforms Ego towards higher purpose, "refinement of emotion" breaks the egocentric structures of a person(Active empathy vs Earth passive acceptance).
Air controls our emotional perception and output, thought it doesn't have monopoly on emotion - it has specific effects that transform emotion: refinement, magnification and focusing on one subject. Air element paints a rich gamut of emotions from basic perceptions towards mental models of artificial complexity  - whethere imagined or not, Air dominant individuals are living inside a rich and fragile emotional world where all events evoke a deep and persistent change in emotion: astral flows surround such people from all sides.
 Air boosting mantras require a serene and controlled environment  to function, in effect demanding a "Purified heart chakra" to be able to control the emotional currents driven by air(a dangerous practice in any congested/urban setting). 
Air centric mudra/mantras/asanas also require defensive perimeters - they attract high-level predators who see emotional energy currents out of persons heart chakra - this energy is Astral Energy in its refined form which powers the Astral plane and Heart chakra is visible as an energy source to astral entities. 
Astral body activation/construction and astral projection are Air-centric practices which take their toll on the physical body - especially if one disconnects/misaligns astral body with physical: this removes vital astral energy from chakra channels and leaves it outside where parasites can easily drain it without engaging defenses of etheric body and aura. The concept of "Loosh" is another term of Air element energy.


Air element is the least compatible with human existence due its energy opposing water.
Astral interference and possession by astral entities will ensue if Air element dominates for prolonged time - most humans cannot afford isolation and anti-astral defenses to safely practice Air-centric mantras - though payoff in terms of spiritual evolution is huge(soul refinement and character uplifting) the risk of using Air-booster methods/mantras/etc is off the scale.
The effect of overcharged air element are comparable with medium to high level of psychosis.
Common effects:
Dehydration, skin problems
Psychosis
Vein constriction, reduced blood flow
High stress levels
Pain(increased sensitivity to all pain), random pains, emotional pain intensified
Hypersensitivity to temperature, sounds, colors,etc 
Reduced auras, "fragile soul" feeling, victim complex
Artistic inspiration to draw/create/invent/improve(with high Ether)
Increased susceptibility to morals/ideology/religion, reduced rational capacity
Emotions dominate, extreme emotion, emotions are felt as "refined/high" or "spiritual"(regardless of their basis)
Emotional reactions to small events, increased susceptibility to  hysteria, lower tolerance to failure/loss
Constant change in emotional states
Intrusive thoughts/entities/voices
Accelerated aging(fluid loss)
Loss of hormone control(hormonal instability)
Emotional breakdowns/escalation(large astral energy flows)
Extreme muscle tension/tremors/seizures (long-term)
Negative entities exploit Air energy as fuel(emotion-eater)

Note that unexpected reduction in Air element(especially with mudras) may cause depression-like effects as the level of air regulates psychic flows. The Air element is best reduced by boosting Water which slowly displaces Air.
