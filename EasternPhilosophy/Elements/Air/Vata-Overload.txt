Vata overload is a state of highly refined emotions, usually perceived as melancholy, spiritual/existential crisis. It is dependent on Air and Ether, elements where Ether is insufficient to contain Air.

Symptoms:
Sense of injustice, anger at the world, rapid refinement of aesthethic judgement, intolerance to flaws, neuroticism, rapid mood changes, dramatization of present or future, thoughts of afterlife/religion/fate, elevated sense of self-importance, intensification and deepining of all emotions, hypersensitivity to pain, increase in potency of fears and phobias, dehydration and dry skin, feelings of confinement(ether loss), malaise, increased intelligence and speed of thought, victim mentality, greater enjoyment of food and change of food tastes(emotional eating), extreme altruism/empathy alternating with hate for the society/nearby people, feeling of "spiritual growth/advancement", distaste for social gatherings, self-isolation, delusions of grandeur, heart palpitations, heart area pain, sensations of disbalance and dread of change, etheric transformations, yellowing of skin on index fingers(air channel), loss of appetite alternating with sudden hunger urges, intensifying visual/aural perception(music sounds richer and more complex, art appears deeper and more refined), loneliness and desire to be alone, intense obsessions over single topic or problem, fast and negative judgement of others.

General outcome:
Either the person adapts to level of emotional refinement or gets back into calmer level, the vata overload will subside on its own when its cause stops being effective(e.g. suffering, anguish, despair).
 Suffering is the core part of vata overload and is disguised as refined feelings of negative origin(Refined Negative Reaction) and victim mentality that underlies the hyper-altruistic mood of vata overload. 

Deliberate inducement:
The quickest way to induce vata overload is heart mantras such as YAM, effective at range dependent on chanter's aura power(typically below 1km for most chakras).
Religious organizations use vata overload as means to induce 'mass religious ecstacy'(ranges of vata-emmitters combine in power) which is conductive to mass hypnosis, energy vampirism or propoganda.
refined art, music, religious expressions and mass chanting all amplify vata, by virtue of being composed in state of vata overload: Such states are considered conduits to astral plane energy to manifest art into lower planes(as mental plane conduits work for idea-thoughtform reification, astral reifies emotion into physical objects/concepts such as musical scores).
