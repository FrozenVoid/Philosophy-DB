Water element is responsible for blood, hormones, libido, raw emotion and general fluids in the body. Letter "I" in mantras opens the water energy channel.
In etheric terms, its the background of vibration/sound/frequency - more water results in increased sound and temperature sensitivity(vibration of matter and heat).
Water element is the component of both Kapha humor[1](Grounding Earth/Water) and Pitta humor(Energizing Fire/Water) allowing to these humors to interact directly as water shifts excess energy to  elements in neglected humor. Mantras utilizing Water element create a countrer balance to Vata(Air/Ether) which is using to cleanse/purify Vata-centric conditions and diseases.
Depletion of water element is associated with aging, psychosis(air-element overabudance) and dementia. 
Overabudance of water may lead to insomnia, restlessness, risky "Hot-blooded" behavior and general agressivity(hormones/sexuality/adrenaline).
Air vs Water: Air competes with water in emotional sphere, where Air controls "refined" emotions and Water control basic/primal emotion, however it would be a mistake to see Air as being a source of refined soul-moving emotion - it just increases the level of sensitivity to all emotionas and adds color gamuts while water controls Depth of Perception allowing to see/hear/expirience on deeper/primal level.
Water is considered sacred in most religions(Water of Life) and its flow signifies the fluidity of life. 
On other hand esoteric views on water(primordial water element) see it as reflection of natural chaos, evolution and ruthless competition for energy(symbolized in blood as aspect of Water).
