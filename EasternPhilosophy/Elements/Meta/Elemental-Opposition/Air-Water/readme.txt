Air-Water opposition: 
(Air)Dryness/Focus/Emotion/rigidity vs 
(Water)fluidity/Chaos/Action in emotional/mental sphere. 

Air-Water balance defines the morality fabric:
Water-based energy flow aligns with instinctual/basic emotional judgement,
Air-based energy flow aligns with refined/intellectual emotional judgement.

When Air predominates the person subtle bodies undergo 'refinement' increasing
their emotional spectrum and sensitivity: sensitivity to events, qualities and
concepts as applied to mind, vata-type intellectualisation is rigid system
thinking with tendency to absolutize and generalize all things.
Air is conductive to creative effort, with refined/complex models reified
into systems that exhibit the inner world of vata-type worldview,
Air is the force of emotional color, creating a high-level emotional state
of ecstasy when a person astral body aligns and absorbs Air-type content.


Water element dominates when person is grounded in reality and his
physical health(based on Water element) is ruled by hormonal cycles,
metabolism and diet. Water-type mindset is characterized by fast, reflexive
 judgement, quick opinion changes and adaptation/inventiveness towards the 
 situation. Water-element allows spontaneous creativity, but without much control
 or refinement, tendency to focus on deep, simple raw emotion
 vs Vata-humor refinement and complexity: Water signifies power and mastery
 at the base technical level, fluid and evolving design that follows
  'mainstream' patterns, common and approachable content that appeals
 for the 'average man'. Water-type emotion is operating on brain chemistry,
 independent on mental state(i.e. non-thinking/instinctual emotion).
