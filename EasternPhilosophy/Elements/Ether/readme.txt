Ether element controls size, shape, growth and cohesion of subtle bodies/chakras/channels/auras - physical body adapts to size dictated by etheric matrix on which its builds.
 Its the basis element from which other elements use space - i.e. Fire exists on Ether space, Earth exists on Ether space, etc. Letter U opens the ether channel in mantras.
Ether space is naturally filled by Air(the astral energy) and may lead to disbalance of material(earth/water) - pure Ether/Air configuration is detrimental to physical body.
Ether and Fire are particularly synergistic, reinforcing each other in a closed loop(Power multiplier) - this also attracts attention of negative entities eager to feed on person boosting his Ether beyond capabilities of defense.
Water has somewhat antagonistic effect on Ether via Air-depletion(Vata humor) and is commonly used to moderate its effect(though water needs to fill its Ether space fully to manifest the depletion process).
The Ether is associated with higher-mental facilities, fluid intellect and inspiration : compared to Air which focused on refined emotion/judging, Ether is more inclined toward mental analysis and imagination.
Though both elements of Vata humor boost inspiration and spirituality they represents different basis chakras (Air =Heart, Ether = Throat). 
Ether is also the highest element which connects to physical body and serves as intermediary to higher-level subtle bodies(connected at throat, third-eye and crown chakra - those in turn connect to chakras above head and the persons spirit). 
Depletion of Ether reduces the strength of this connection to "soul"(i.e. astral and higher bodies), though it also reduces the strenghth suffering/emotion(controlled by Vata humor, with Air taking the emotional and Ether the raw consious expirience of pain).
