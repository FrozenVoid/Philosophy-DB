Letter "D" draws Fire element in its higher-aspect(intellect)
Letter "R" draws Fire element in its lower-aspect(raw energy)
,Letter "A" opens the fire channel(flow), terminal "G" concentrates Fire.

In terms of realms, Fire resonates with energies both of Underworlds(incl.Hells) and Upper mental planes of refined energy, with Fire directed down(lower chakras) the person engages with violent physical drives and extreme views on the world - while Fire directed up(Higher chakras) tranforms its energy into burning passions of intellectual research, rationality,  science and enlightment. Fire is entwined with the concepts of morality, judgement and revenge.
Fire in itself depends on Ether space to exists, and its intellectual properties are limited by space of Ether allocated to it. With confined Fire, it inflames or consumes other elements - specificially Earth and Water, moving a person into a state of mania and unceasing burning desire to perform something to spend their Fire element - a thirst for action be it videogames/sports/violence. 
Fire is not neutral energy - it subsumes stability and aids Chaos, a person thrown into a whirlwind of events and situation driven by their Fire nature.
Depletion of Fire lead to increase of Earth and general passivity - an Order from Chaos, the crystallization of Water into Ice(Earth) and drop in temperature/passion/energy.
