Nourishing the Vital Principle consists in suppressing the causes of 
death and creating in oneself the immortal body which will replace the 
mortal body. The causes of death are especially the Breath of Grains and
 the Breath of Bloody Food: hence the alimentary regimens which are 
designated by the generic name Abstinence from Grains. One must succeed 
in replacing vulgar food with the Food of the Breath, like an aerophagia
 which consists of breathing air in, holding it in as long as possible 
without allowing it to escape and, while it is held in, making it pass, 
in identical mouthfuls with great gulps of water, from the trachea into 
the esophagus, so that it can be sent on into the stomach like real 
food. The body is made of Breaths, like all things; but it is made of 
coarse breaths, whereas air is a light, subtle and pure Breath. Vulgar 
food, after digestion, supplies the body with the Breaths of the Five 
Flavors, common and impure Breaths which make it heavy. By contrast, 
Food of the Breath little by little replaces the coarse matter of the 
body with light, pure Breaths; and when the transformation is completed,
 the body is immortal.
