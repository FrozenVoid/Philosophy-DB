     Finger           Element
    Thumb             Fire/Chaos/Lower Mental/Will/Energy/Action 
    Index               Air/Emotion/Ego/Astral body/Color/Desire realm(Astral planes)
    Middle            Space/Ether/Higher Mental bodies/Sound/Etheric body/energy
    Ring                Earth/Order/Inertia/Physical body/Self-control/Structure/Physical plane
    Little               Water/Blood/Vital body/Absorption/Movement/Renewal/Sexuality/Patala(underworld)



Aurveda:
    Earth, the principle of inertia
    Water, the principle of cohesion
    Fire, the principle of radiance
    Wind, the principle of vibration(Air)
    Ether, the principle of pervasiveness.

Although neglected in most sources,
 Void element(Emptiness,Shunya) is discussed as component 
of Ether, though it opposes it(Akasha(substrate) vs Emptiness(nothing)). Palm center is the Void energy nexus, and its associated with Ether depletion.

Element opposition:
Ring(Earth) Opposes Thumb(Fire),
 Little(Water) Opposes Index(Air).
Middle(Ether) Opposes palm center(Void)

Element reinforcement:
Air<>Void
Ether<>Fire
Water<>Earth

Core mudras:
Pran(Prithvi+Jal=Physical Energy),
Apan(Pritvhi+Akash=Cleansing), 
Vyan(Akash+Gyan= Mental energy)


GUIDELINES:
 Touching the Tip of the finger to the Thumb balance the element represented by the finger.
 Touching the Tip of the finger to the base of the Thumb decreases the element represented by the finger.
Touching the Tip of the Thumb to the base of the finger increases the element represented by the finger.
Other sources(Thumb pressure applied to x):
Each finger is divided into three parts. When we touch the lower part, the corresponding element is increased. When we touch the middle part, the corresponding element is decreased. When we touch the upper part, the corresponding element is balanced. This is the basic principle of the Science of Mudras. 


Putting a finger inside fist of other hand can block that element channel  immediately(like a firewall).
Putting finger in the ear channel connect it with head-ether circuit.
Usage of one hand mudras:
1.One hand only(focus center)
2.Two hands(balancing flow)
3.Interval(change active hand in#1 after interval)
