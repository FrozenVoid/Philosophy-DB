Method:place thumb over ring finger.(Open surya:place ring finger tip on ball of thumb(seems to reduce inffl. of main method)
Increase fire element, metabolism/vigor/strength, mental acuity(IQ/speed of thought), 
Decreases Earth element(Anti-thesis to Prithvi mudra stability/anti-ego ).
Side effects: similar to loss of prithvi element long-term(egoism, heat, excess energy, infflamation).
Central to Agni-Yoga: cultivation of Agni(Fire element) as spiritually liberating of Earth corruption(Earth element) and astral realms(Air element).
Increase the radiance of aura: higher-level projection is simplified, with it also attention of negative entities as this mudra makes one a target.
