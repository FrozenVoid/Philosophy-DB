The key idea of 'disattachment' is distancing from the 'self-place', essentially not taking what is happening to the 'self' as a tragedy but as learning expirience.
To reduce psych./mental damage from living and expiriencing events, imagine that you're observer-consciousness entity within first-person videogame, where mind is an proxy actor depicting thoughts and expiriencing emotions suitable for the current moment, you don't  control(but mind-actor follows your wishes as best as he can) what you do/emote/think and struggling to retain control over the 'video-game world' is the primary source of discontent(samsara).

Instead stoically accept the video-game world as some sort of morality play where mind-actor(entity playing the role of your character, which is partially directed by you) is examined and its inner motivations/inclinations/flaws revealed for the observer to derive some lesson or spiritual insight.

i.e. body and mind are not actually driven by you and you're merely the observer, giving cues and preferences for the actors in the play(what to explore, points of interest(of course the "mainstream" information is fed to mind-actor by default is the default way the mind-actor will reacts - going off-script requires the observer to intervene and enforce their will to the mind-actor)).

 All emotions and thoughts are transmitted to consciousness unedited and raw, with all the bloopers/mistakes/glitches as is.
The idea of VR doesn't completely describe the expirience, because even "the VR" is actually an embedded "mini-game" withing the larger "omni-reality" game - in fact all artificial worlds and their characters are another form of mind-actors (avatars/NPCs) to explore various scenarios for the observer-conscioussness benefit and advancement.

Dreams, projections and meditations are different levels of reality(planes) that are also VR-like - only at highest levels the observer-consciousness is free from the shackles of being bound to the mind-actor and expiriences "True Reality" of existence without intermediate actors/bodies/proxies.

Similar to this idea, the mental anguish over karma/sins/mistakes and general malaise over moral flaws should be applied to the mind-actor observed(critique the actor, not yourself), not the "true self" which is just observing it from the mind-actor.(True self or the "higher self" is the spiritual idea of our spirit being more distant from life expirience and only intervening in critical moments to direct the mind driving the incarnated entity)

A visual idea to illustrate the concept of 'observer consciousness':
Imagine a little man inside your brain - a "Mind-actor" receiving direct feelings from sense-devices and pushing buttons on the control panels of "the brain machine".
Now imagine there is a ghost inside the little man's head that monitors its thoughts and gives the little man directions/advice - its the observer-consciousness.(in reality there are multiple layers of proxies relaying/adapting/filtering mental streams up and down, with higher more distant from the little man "mind-actor" and lower level proxy-minds very engaged with the "world" which mind-actor inhabits.)
