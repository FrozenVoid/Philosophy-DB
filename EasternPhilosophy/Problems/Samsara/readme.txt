Samsara is a category of realms
where suffering exists as concept.
Nirvana is assummed to be free 
of suffering, though its connection
with Samsaric realms and entities
 implies itself also a part of
  Samsara(as being in Nirvana
  can exist/manifest in Samsara)
  and containing potential suffering
  as future of being living in:
 i.e. Nirvana is not extra-planar
  reality, due its connection to
  Samsara.

Samsara also implies lack
of Absolute Good(a universal
altruistic force,principle or entity)
 since existence of Samsara contradicts
  such entity that opposses evil, however existence of
   Absolute Evil is also impossible due
    Samsara not being destroyed for
    not being evil enough.
 The above dualistic concepts of
  Good and Evil are insufficient to
  understand the world-systems that
 Samsara operates on, as well as 
 any polar measure that proclaims
 existence of Absolute due corruption 
 inherent in Samsaric existence:
 e.g. there is no Absolute X in 
 Samsara since to exist such 
 entity/force/object must form a 
 specific Samsaric form and use 
 energy of Samsaric planes to exist
 within, thus Absolute X entities
  can only be extra-planar and 
  their interference in Samsara
  would be corrupted by
  Samsaric forces and planar features.
