The Purity Filter hypothesis is that the universe/samsara is multi-life purity filter to weed out the unworthy of nirvana/heavens. The basic idea is the samsara is a multi-life test to purify and grow spiritual qualities.
This common idea is often the basis of systems of morality centered on self-restriction, afterlife and karma - all of which depend on existence of benevolent control(vs non-personal cosmic law).

Refutation of benevolent control("The Good Side is in control"):

1.The beings which maintain the filter are not interested in spiritual freedom of all, only a extremely small minority succeeds at breaking out, everyone else remain trapped in samsara. Essentially a few manage to 'cheat the system', but no one changes the system to help others.

2.If the filter was working, existence of "evil gods" or demiurges would not occur as they would lack purity/compassion to be in control.

3.If the filter was fair, it would not have dead-end realms from which escape is nearly impossible:instead there are many feedback loops to keep beings trapped in samsara.

4.Beings lose memory of previous lives, but retain all the karma: this impedes learning or progress as specific lifes are set back by circumstances easily avoided with past-life experience.
 Samsara corrupts much more than it purifies.

5.Knowledge of Filters nature and ways to beat it are hidden and corrupted in the realms where its needed the most.
The idea of Purity Filter is incompatible with fairness due its condition being applying to both High-level planes and Low-level planes equally, without taking in account the specific local circumstances and conditions.
