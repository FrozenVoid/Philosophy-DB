This sutra provides an alternative to 'sunyata' doctrine(where all forms are
considered empty of essence), proposing inherent buddha-matrix 
within all sentient creatures - an equivalent to a personal soul
without any personal characteristics( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Buddhism)#Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na_Mah%C4%81parinirv%C4%81%E1%B9%87a_S%C5%ABtra ).
