Rainbow body mantras creates a chakra
 standing wave that powers up higher level
spititual bodies by synchronization of chakras
in a specific manner(chakra resonance, where chakra
 colors are energized into a synergistic 'rainbow wave'
 of chakra fields(elemental energies)):
the rhythm and periodicity of these mantras
chanting in precise sequence is aiding in realization of Rainbow Body:
end result of such practice is dematerialization
and ascension to one of 'Pure Abodes'(high level
 mental planes) in same energy body(soul complex)
 without intermediary afterlife(astral planes).


Example:

Aa Ah Ha Sha Sa Ma

(a rainbow mantra has to activate all chakras/elements
 in a specific sequence, like a wave, 
 that is minimum 5 elemental syllables.
A random mantra set will likely not work as
'rainbow body mantra' due have energetic imbalances
 that prevents a standing wave forming:
 its possible to sense where energy flows and 
elemental influence of cardinal direction, cloth
 color to achieve a better 'resonance' at place)
