Mantras are a form of brainwave entrainment.
By mentally focusing on specific words, repeating the words creates a Brainwave Pattern(activations of same neurons, as if memory chip was referenced repeatedly).
(this doesn't even require vocalizations or subvocal mental recall, only memory of it)
Which by itself puts the brain into "loop mode", forcing to entrain a specific set of frequencies associated with mantra intrerpretation(that is expected to not change, ie.e. same response/reflex to mantra is what makes the brainwave stable).
Within this trance-like state of "loop mode" the mind being to refocus into subtle bodies(etheric,astral, mental) being deprived of material response/reflex cycles subsumed by mantra pushing them out of the mind. 
This state is essentially a form of meditation stabilized by brainwaves("meditation on the words") created withing the loop mode and negating the feedback/reflex qualities of mindstream(the mind doesn't flow into background mental activity and outward focus) - as if the mind concentration on the mantra, shuts down everything non-essential and hypnosis-like trance isolation from outside world begins.
As mantra roots itself inside the "loop mode" mechanisms(mimicry, memes,learning,repetition) the mantra recall/repeat cycles shifts to semi-automatic mode where mind behaves like a computer stuck into an infinite loop, neutralizing the "monkey mind" aspect of mental circuitry and allowing higher circuits to take control. Mantras look from this perspective like a computer exploit allowing unrestricted access to the "inner mind"(OS-level vs user-level).
