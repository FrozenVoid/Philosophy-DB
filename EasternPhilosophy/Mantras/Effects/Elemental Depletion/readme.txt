Mantras which draws specific element as source
(e.g. IIM draws water, sacral chakra)
slowly deplete that element, especially at time
of day where such element is depleted by default.
Time of day elements is Indian Vata/Kapha/Pitta divisions of day.
 Vowels: I=Water,U=Ether,A=Fire,O=Earth,E=Air( Doubled vowels at start(EEM vs EM) start depletion much faster.)
Example with :OM (O=Earth M=Ether), with prolonged chanting Earth is depleted -> Leading to more 
Fire/Ether/Air(Vata/Pitta) and some Water(due Kapha depletion).


(Dominant Element/Secondary Element).
||Time of Day||Element Abudance||Element Depletion||
||02:00-6:00|| Air/Ether||  Water/Fire  ||
||6:00-10:00||Earth/Water||Fire/Ether||
||10:00-14:00||Fire/Water|| Air/Earth||
||14:00-18:00||Ether/Air|| Water/Fire||
||18:00-22:00||Water/Earth||Fire/Air ||
||22:00-02:00||Water/Fire||Earth/Air  ||

Mechanism: 
Initial period  mantra (e.g.OM) increases 
Earth element/boost Earth-centric energy configuration.
Rebound period(especially magnified
during depletion hours), the mantra(e.g.OM)
starts depleting Earth and Increasing its opposite(Fire).
Rebound period is shorter when the element is already depleted in a person.

(Note:Sleeping at anytime adds Air and Ether significantly ,
 but mantras in dreams have their own energetic
 mechanics dependent on plane where dream is projected.)
