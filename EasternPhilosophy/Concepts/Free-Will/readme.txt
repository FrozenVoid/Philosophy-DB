Determinism, randomness and free will are independent:
Randomness does not imply free will or Non-determinism
Free-will doesn't imply randomness or Non-determinism
Non-determinism doesn't imply  randomness or free will.

A book character has no free-will, his actions are not random and entire plot is pre-determined
[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism

An interactive novel unlike a book allows to choose a path for the reader, where such choice makes the novel path is not deterministic but finite in scope(the idea most applies to ability to pick a path from many).
[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation


A software RNG produces seemingly random numbers, but it lacks any 'will'
 and the numbers are pre-determined.
[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predeterminism 

A quantum RPG produces unpredictable random numbers(hardware),however the numbers lack any 'free will'.  
[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy

A chess game path is completely predetermined and non-random, but the player has the free will to pick the exact path. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton
[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism

A theoretical Non-deterministic game where all paths are fixed, but complexity allows non-determinism.

[6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics)#Overview

Virtual Reality has Free will(for players), randomness, but its structure makes it deterministic(unlike NFA and Interactive Novel,VR is linear).
[7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality

Reality is assumed to have all three qualities.
