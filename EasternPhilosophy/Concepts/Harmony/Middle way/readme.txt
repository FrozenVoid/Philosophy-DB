The chaos vs order morality can be reconceptualized
as choice between purity(order) and freedom(chaos).
At the extreme of purity the mind becomes robotic 
and crystallizes the system of morals:
extreme asceticism, constant self-criticism, fear of sin/error/mistake. 
At the extremes of freedom mind becomes chaotic
and corrupted with randomness:
sensual desires, addictions, loss of self-control.
Both approaches are psychologically damaging: 
Buddhism recognizes this phenomena and
recommends to stay neutral between them:
the Middle way which balances purity(asceticism) 
with freedom(self-indulgence) leading to harmony :
