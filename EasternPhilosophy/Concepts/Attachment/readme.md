(material) Attachment is the anchoring of the mind into some substance of the material plane. The attachment is the binding force that draws the soul to reincarnate into the plane with most attachments: so e.g. if one has more attachments to dream matter/entities he will incarnate in astral/mental realms where most attachments lie.
The most damaging aspect of material attachment is energy expended by maintaining the binding channel, using mental energy to focus on material - instead of thought as is(i.e. thoughts are corrupted/shaped/transformed by the mind absorbed in material attachment), thought is centered on material space. To break from the circle of increasing attachment its necessary to unbind the mind from the focused object: 

meditation shifts the context to explicitly mental space where attachment is are malleable and environmental stress doesn't "snap the mind back into material world".
To achieve disattachment its necessary to transform and analyze emotions that power the attachment:
The sense of comfort and satisfaction, desire and longing,
deep mental unrest which is reduced by attachment,etc.
In many cases the attachment is a form of escaping higher emotional expiriences that are suppressed with low-level material pleasures(sweetening the experience) and thrills(to replace real stress). 

To understand attachment, its necessary to trace back formative experience of its creation: the emotions anchoring the attachment in the mind are built in this foundation and fed by continuing focus on attachment object/subject.


Examples:
A.Clinging to fantasy: preferring to mentally escape into fantasy enviroment to reduce discomfort. 
B.Desire : mental focusing on desire creates tulpas of object of desire which attach to the person, to influence energy expenditure(desiring).
C.Self-image attachment: desire to improve the physical body creates a mental object(tulpa) that attaches to the mind.
D.Attachment to activity: the activity creates addicting energy patterns that form from the focus on that activity, like a self-reinforcing loop.
E.Attachment to social status: the person creates a self-image from a social role and tries to adhere to social expectations, getting attention and praise reinforces the social role acceptance and integration into the mind.
The 'social role self-image' is a tulpa-personality.
