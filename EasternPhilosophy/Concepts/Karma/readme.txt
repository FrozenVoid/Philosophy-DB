Karma can be conceptualized as harmonization of 'karmic scores',
where person's karmic score influences their future like a 
financial credit score creates a measure of trustworthness:
this can be seen as 'cold, emotionless' karmic math that doesn't
mesh with people expectations of justice as the karma system
works on metaphysical level where causality chains are viewed in
a holistic, system-influencing manner(all planes and subtle bodies
bound to single system), with subtle acts carrying great effects.

Karmic influence can be direct consequences('instant karma')
and indirect
'karmic debt' that later materializes: a particularly severe
imbalance carries over to next incarnation of the soul.

Karma cleansing: some mantras and various prayers/incantations,
will result in 'karma cleansing'(a subtle body configuration 
that is suited for expelling karmic residue), at cost of its fruits ripening
sooner, 'releasing the karma' and restoring balance. 

Karmic residue: subtle bodies host trauma thoughtforms and injuries
 sustained due various actions, acting as karmic burden and coloring
  the person's aura. Can be repaired with mantra chanting
  to some extent,  but generally requires major lifestyle changes.
  
Cheating karma: some people using occult means can  transfer
karma or reduce its burden with magical rituals/devices/etc,
however
 there are spiritual entities that monitor this cheating 
 and will act to restore karmic balance
 (at cost to their own of course);
 this is the basis
 of religion's 'karmic guardians' or 'system enforcers'.
Even in absence of such correction, the system
has a trick up its sleeve and generates karma for the 
'karma-cheating action' on the higher level that acts on the 
upper subtle bodies(that are normally not manipulated 
from below): this can be seen 
as 'corruption of magicians/occultists' at their bodies
 and minds are influenced from subtle energetic leaks
 created due manipulation of their karmic burden, forcing
 them into more manipulation and vampirism to restore
 their energy, further trapping them with karmic debt.

Inherent karma: by being born on the material plane,
its residents carry over the local plane karmic burden,
the collective karma of entire plane/world/system as whole:
an example is 'inherent karma-generating property' of any
predator species to kill and consume dead bodies.
