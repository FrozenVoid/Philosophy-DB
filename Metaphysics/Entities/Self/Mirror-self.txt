Self-image appearing in mirrors,
photographs and paintings, is
 actually a tulpa: the ego manifests
 such tulpa due focus on own
 image forming energy channels to
 mirrors or photo-containers,
 which also form cords to person's
  mental body - making the items
  linked with self-identity(
  actually mirror tulpa latching
on ego desires).

Positive aspects:
in deference to the virtual tulpa
in the mirror the person will
try to improve ones appearance
or behavior, as it demonstrates
to the Self its 'social image' that
is aiding conscience as external
 counter-balance to egocentric
obsessions/desires with concrete
 evidence of emotional/physical 
 state the person is in(i.e.
 accurate external(unbiased) self-assessment, as opposed
 to inner feelings).
 
 Negative aspects:
 Vanity and obsession with 
 own status in society are heavily
 influenced by perception of others:
 however mirror actually gives
 the 'external perception' to the
 mirror-tulpa (which feeds on self-focus)
that would want more energy - thus
obsessive looking at own image
begins to distort the Self into
subservience to the tulpa.

Photography and paintings:
mirror tulpa will feed on any 
attention, any people looking at
 what the Self considers its
 'best image' the entity in
 that image is 'mirror tulpa'
that person wants to become:
a photoshopped/abstract image
that reflects an imaginary
unreachable goal - the Self
is bound to its social image
as 'external image' takes hold
 due exposure and expectation:
 i.e. person now has an obligation
 *(constructed by deference to
 mirror tulpa) to perform as own
 image to maintain social status.


The emotional conflict of 
self-image(mirrors) and constructed
tulpa image(fantasy 'ideal self') feeds the
self-focus and grants even more
power to the tulpa, making the
person sensitive to visual appearance,
fashion, health/fitness in desperate
 attempts to appease own tulpa.
