Self as described in most Eastern philosophies is distinct, biologically-centered identity of the mind more similar to Western concept of Ego(but not Superego/Unconscious).
It is evolutionary adapted form of social thinking that acts in self-interest, but is not the Will of a person: it is a motivation factor in doing and desiring but doesn't have direct control of the Will like a command center advisor.

Understanding how mind identity/persona works and disentangling its influences is critical to enlightenment: however supressing the Self and denying its reality may lead to depersonalization and derealization  disorders(linked to Ego-death process/ psychedelic drugs/ extreme deep meditation) as mind tries to construct a compensating narrative to replace the Self. 
Normal social life requires some form of Self, regardless of how the self is viewed from the outside: its a fundamental aspect of an external persona.
