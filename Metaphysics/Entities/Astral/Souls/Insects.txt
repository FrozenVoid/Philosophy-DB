Insects are smallest animals to have astral-level soul,
in contrast to fungi, bacteria and mold which are driven by
mental plane entities(and can be controlled without inhabiting them).

The insectoid aliens(e.g. Mantids) represent a evolutionary
path of this type of soul but insects on Earth lack the 
advancement of Mantids - they however have communicative
abilities that are inherent to hive-based communication:
they are "more social" in this respect than any mammal(which
are limited with Dunbar number of social links).


Spiritual consequences of consuming insects:
If the insect soul is attached in some organic matter,
it will release it in the digestive tract and there
it could attach itself to human vital matrix(ether-astral binding
with physical body). The animals which consume insects
 likely have some digestive shielding or specific defenses
which allowed them to evolve into that role, but humans
don't depend on such evolution.
