Beacon parasites are a category of 
astral spirits that attract
more powerful spirits to 
possess the host:
Their methods:
1.Invoking the spirit's name through
the throat chakra vocalization.
The parasites induce obsession with
 specific names by repeating them 
 as mantra, inserting them into 
 mindstream thoughts and charging
  energy of specific words.
 
2.Modifying host's energy signature(
aura and chakra frequencies).
(turning one into an astral beacon
for attracting specific type
of spirits)

3.Inserting specific ideas and
 thought-patterns to increase 
 subservience and docility for
host-spirit interaction.

Infection with these parasites
 is more dangerous than simple
 energy leeches(that people think
 of when 'astral parasites' are
 mentioned), as the channels
 to astral entities allow much
 more powerful entities to attach.
