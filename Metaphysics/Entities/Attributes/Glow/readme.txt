An entity with self-glow has developed its chakras to a degree where it
generates a field of colored light as an 'glow aura'(this doesn't mean the entity is good).
a general proxy for being power is the strenght of its glow,
with color of glow being the realm of its power
(chakra color-> plane category).
E.g. a red light glowing being has developed its root chakra (lower realms such as Earth)
