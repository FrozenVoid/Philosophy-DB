Anthropomorphism is the egregore re-shaped in human-compatible form,
similar to earlier God/ess of Something being imagined as a
supernatural human-like entity 
responsible for that Something(egregore of Something fed by belief).
An egregore in its abstract form is a 'Name with energy', the name
is the control pattern(Mantra-name)
of egregore entity which is fed by mentioning
of the Name and sending energy by thinking/imagining the egregore.
By depicting the egregore as human-like it upgrades it status to
allow it to create sympathethic connections exclusive to inter-humna
relationships(a promiment example is the anthro 'Waifu' egregore group
which are excellect connectors vs 'logo' non-anthro brand images which are
 weakly memetic and require constant reinforcement).

Egregore itself may shape its own image to increase popularity,
by connecting with cultural actors and influencing their creativity.
All 'fictional' entities at their core are tendrils of specific egregores
formed in some fantasy and actualized in the cultural layer by creative class.
