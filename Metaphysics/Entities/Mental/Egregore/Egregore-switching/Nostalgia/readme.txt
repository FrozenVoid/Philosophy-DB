Nostalgia is a form of egregore switching that
is drive to reconnect to egregores from the past,
instead of current configuration.
Usually this is caused by desires to stabilize
the mental landscape with past memories.

'Pseudo-nostalgia' is similar desire to recconect with
older cultural egregores, without a linking memory 
from the period where such egregores formed or became popular:
its essentially the same connection forming for the first time
under a cultural context where it considered 'old'/'retro'.
