A song can be considered a thoughtform spread by
its chanters(mentally or otherwise) - similar to mantra thoughtforms
 generated by mass chanting(e.g. concerts force a mental chanting in the brain).
A popular song may form a rudimentary mind as energy in its fans
 powers up enough to create an egregore of the song,
 absorbing energy from chakras of listeners/chanters(listening
 is essentially mental chanting).
 
 In this context the idea of 'earworm' can be explained easily
 as infective tendril of an egregore-song
 attaching itself to the victim, as memory is already embedded:
 stirring the memory to feed off emanations of that song-memory
 as its recalled in mental chanting.
