Imagine for a moment you're interested in flags
and one day suddenly discover the colors of
American flag are called out "Red, Green and Blue"
 and every single reference and website
 has "changed" to RGB. People look at you 
as insane to suggest that it somehow was
different and laugh it off.
All picture show Green. Only a few rare
websites with sketchy titles have a 
'variant' version where white exists and
you found that actually some think its 
was changed:no one takes them seriously.
It would be hard to argue
for something so basic and established to 
be wrong but your memory is filled with opposite.
This is the Mandela Effect.

The "conventional" memory error explanation
 thrown aside, there have few pssobilities:
 1.Either the timeline is manipulated
 by someone with an agenda or timeline
 is edited by higher powers.
 
2.Reality is mutating and changing,
as if virtual OS image gets corrupted in a VM.

3.Someone has access to people's brains
and rewrites memories selectively.
