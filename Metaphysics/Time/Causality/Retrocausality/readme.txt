An influence that propagates backward in time, violating 
the sequential order of events(linear determinism); 
Basic ideas
A.Event in the timeline has qualities that are shared
with the timeline itself -
the influence is not limited to event place/future itself.
B.This influence would be embedded in the timeline fabric from the start,
since the event alters the past of its timeline by influencing its energy flows.
The timeline feeds energy to pre-event sequences reinforcing their own existence,
constructing an editied version of reality(current timeline).
C.Events can be connected backward to their causes, as if the timeline is
split into a series of backward loops and forward trunks, competing
for energy and redirecting their flow(trunks are progress timelines, loops
are status quo 'stasis periods' which capture the energy)
D.The influence is a process that shapes the timelines and their energy flows,
like a giant ball of loops,lines and circles that feeds into itself,
grows new timelines(trunks) which expand into new loops
(like a big ball of messed up, living yarn).
E.Timelines are not static and linear, but dynamic and dependent on matter
worlds inside the timeline for their energy flow
(time flow is a process which needs energy and direction).
