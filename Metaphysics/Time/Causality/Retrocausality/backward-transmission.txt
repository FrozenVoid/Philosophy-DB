A backward transmission is a retrocausal energy flow,
like e.g. a radio wave from future arriving to the past receiver.
The hypothethical medium in which timeline events are embedded
is connected to some loop-like curve with them sending tunnels into
other places in the timeline - as if energy flow has crossed out-of-timeplace
towards another timeplace that is connected to it through a different dimension.
