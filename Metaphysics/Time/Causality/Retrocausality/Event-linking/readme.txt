Event linking is a purely retrocausal timeline-splitting technique which does not rely on random number generator.
(Note:Dimensional Jumping and Timeline-Splitting is the same thing from different perspectives: both imply multiple worlds that can be chosen from)
Method:
1.A future event is chosen, which has outcomes X,Y,Z
2.Each of the outcomes is allocated a response X1,Y1,Z1.
3.At the event outcome the response is followed as if one was a robot scripted by the algorithm.

Explanation:
This creates a retro-causal influence from the future event to  your decision to follow in response - i.e. whatever you plan to respond will create new future(and was influenced)..at the moment of planning from noticing the future event to writing down responses.
Since its not random, it relies on event outcomes to determine randomness(not required in principle).

Outcome responses can be optimized to create a better timeline, instead of reacting as it happens.
Unlike future-planning that adapt to circumstances, the responses direct the timeline before the event occurs. (It however requires discipline to actually follow on with the response.)
