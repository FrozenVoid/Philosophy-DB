Eating or drinking at night brings one contact
with rising(after sunset)/falling(after midnight) yin energies
and opens influences to lower material sphere(linked with lower etheric forces):
its better to avoid eating 4-5 hours before sunset, at night and
1/2 hour after sunrise until the sun energy cleanses the area.
The optimal time for eating/drinking material stuff is during
midday when the sun is at peak power and digestive energy 
clears material filth off the etheric body very fast:
avoid eating at dark rooms or complete shade to increase solar influence.
Reference: ingestion of food(Earth) and liquids(Water),
carbonated beverages and food with air pockets(Air),
Spices(Fire) and electrically charged substances(Ether).
can be influenced by sun cycle period:
(Fasting increases void(sunyata) elemental influence, reducing Ether
which is the goal at nighttime)
