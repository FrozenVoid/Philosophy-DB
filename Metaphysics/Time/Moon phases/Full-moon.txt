Full moon, reflecting most of Sun energy, is a potent
conductor of Water element: it activates Air-water axis
and will allow to manipulate astral/etheric aspects(magical energy).
Moon reflects Fire(Sun/yang) into opposite
(shared by Pitta humor) neightbour(Water/Yin),
acting as giant Fire->Water converter, which enables it 
to pacify and control Air(Astral plane energy) and increase Earth
(by its sharing Water/Earth kapha humor).
Air-water axis shifts towards the Water(full moon)
or Air(new/dark moon).

At night of Full moon, staring directly at the Moon(which unlike
the Sun is completely safe) will infuse one with 
reflected Water element.
Lunar energy is yin/cold: cleansing/downshifting/calming,
it pacifies Air element and reduces inner Fire.
Emotions evoked by Lunar energy are linked to sacral chakra:
animal instincts, fertility/libido, will to power,
hormones and fundamental mood:
moon rules over material forms(Kapha humor).
Note that Full moon will cause insomnia and disrupt night-day
cycle as lunar energy dominance shifts one out of solar phase:
its magical utility comes at a cost and shifts one towards the 
nearby etheric planes(Night/dark) and 
its entities(lunar entities/color blue/cold/vampiric), 
as lunar energy will weaken throat chakra(fed by inner Fire).
