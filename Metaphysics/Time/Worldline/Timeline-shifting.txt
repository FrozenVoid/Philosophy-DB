Hypothethical mechanism:
A timeline shift occurs when a state of etheric projection
subtly detaches
the link of physical body to etheric body(silver cord?)
during the transition between sleep stages(astral travel)/
meditation(mental projection)/waking(esp. 'false awakening')/
astral projections(early detached etheric stage),
allowing the anchored body position to switch to nearby timeline
physical body, switching places with alternate self of the target timeline.
