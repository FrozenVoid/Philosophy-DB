Reality stabilization requires that 
A.Large amounts of humans(or aware animals) are present
B.They project sufficient etheric fields
C.They project similar mental frequencies.
The resulting "reality field" is a lightweight egregore cloud that is creating "consensus reality". The most effective reality stabilization requires city-level population and similar belief systems.
Such systems are protected from (most) interdimensional incursions and malevolent entities by excluding their frequencies(point C) and pushing our their aura(point B).
In effect reality stabilization is an unconscious safety protocol that enabled human civilization to expand using the form of large villages and gradually cities as shared safe space with stable reality.
In other places, such as wilderness and deserts, the level of reality stabilization is not marginally better than a "thin place" with no safety whatsoever from reality warping entities.
