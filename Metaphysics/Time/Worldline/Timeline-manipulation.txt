To manipulate a timeline it is necessary to break event chains
by introducing a random chaotic element(e.g. random number) into the timeline to force a split. By associating specific numbers with outcomes in a certain way, its possible to influence timeline toward a specific state: usually this can be conceptualizing as 'moving the choice source' to non-self(i.e. allowing
 self to be directed by external random generator) and simultaneously directing the possibilities in your favor.

General method:
1.Finding a source of randomness:
example:
Free Quantum randomness(no quota) generator:
https://qrng.anu.edu.au/#
or more user-friendly:
https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=10&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=on
This generates a (truly) random number range:1-10(inclusive)

2.Creating a split-list of possibilities(it is implied that list is not reused).
Generate list of 10 distinct actions, now click the link and perform the action(preferably that will affect the external world) equal to number generated by generator.
Now the timeline is split into 10 parts(you've connected randomness to actual events) where your action(presumably created to favor some positive change) is both random and non-self originating(not from 'mainstream timeline').

3. Repeat #2 by creating new unique split-lists:
After several iterations you'll live in your own unique timeline that is centered on you(the splitter).

Parameters of split:
Uniqueness factor: The random event chosen by number has a uniqueness factor(the probability of the event occurring by default).
Choosing unlikely actions and making the event unique increases the splitting from original timeline - like breaking a script, however
 the actions should not have detrimental effect or start a negative reaction chain. 

External scope: The quality of action cascading forward in time. E.g. actions that create new unique consequences are "externally large" vs actions that are "externally small" that don't matter in grand timeline(actions that don't propagate unique consequences).
Typically "externally small" actions can be folded back into the timeline when their effects are identical to similar actions, but they can change reality in unforeseen .

Globality: The action affecting large number of people(e.g. posting a new post a forum) are changing timelines faster and more effective than local changes(in most cases). However the impact depends on  causality chains from event promoting unique reactions/consequences.

Note: Timeline manipulation attracts attention of powerful egregore entities and alters events so they may create undue focusing on your person/area/surroundings, the center or 'splitting point'.
