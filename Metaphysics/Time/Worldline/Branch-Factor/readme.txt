Timeline branch factor is the idea of "branching factor"(from game trees) applied to timeline: like in e.g. chess 20 possible moves create x20 branching factor(however chess is limited to the content of game board).
The concept of parallel world is a "nearby timeline" which is trans-temporally linked to common origin. This "common origin" is the branch location(like a chess opening branching to different variations).


The linear chunks of a timeline have a branch factor x1, where nothing strays from "mainstream". A dual split on a timeline create equally probable branches(50% chance,x2), triple split 33.3% chance,x3 etc - however as the branch factor grows the probabilities become more biased in favor of some branch(can't keep equal chances of occuring) so the timeline forcefully shifts towards that branch to the extent possible(this also makes it ripe for timeline manipulation with biased random choices ). 
A timeline(and everything living in it) has the property of retaining stability and coherence(resilience to manipulation) by default, with forces outside the timeline having no such limits.
