Worldlines of different worlds can intersect
and influence from their nearby points:
these points are timeline periods where
two or more more worldlines can blend their 
energies and share astral/mental plane links
that their denizens anchor in.
Worldline junctions allow powerful energies
to change worlds from within as their anchor
point in mental/astral/causal planes meet
more advanced or energetic analogues,
cahrging the worldline with potential and 
inspiring change in the physical plane it
belongs in.
