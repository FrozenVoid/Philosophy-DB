What people refer to as "Fictional Worlds"
are mental plane localities linked into
physical worldline. Its closest analogues
are heavens constructed by religious belief
in astral plane: the collective belief in fictional
 world charges their mental plane location with
 power sufficient to alter worldlines:
These alterations link worldline into a
junction with collective imaginary energy of
fictional worlds, enpowering entities that
people believe in(e.g. Superman) and constructing
 locations (e.g. Gotham City) from 
 focused energy of millions of believers.
