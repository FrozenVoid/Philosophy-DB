Most travel is conducted through a scheme where
person travels A->B->A returning home:
this is an energy loop which gathers elemental flows
from the path travelled and changes subtle bodies composition.
However most travel is energy-neutral:
1. If the path is mirrored (back and forth path idential),
the energetic changes are neutralized(with some small energy loss).

2.If the direction of return path B->A is opposite elementally
(e.g. A->B north-south B->A south-north) and length of 
return path & forward path are roughly equal 
the loop is neutral again.

3.If the person creates a figure 8 loop path; the sides
of the loop neutralize each other if roughly equal in size.

Energy-changes come from unusual, complex paths:
1.By breaking a linear path into many complex loops/circles,
the adept can forcefully absorb elemental flows from
various cardinal directions.
2.With clever planning, the return path doesn't neutralize
energetic changes: this means simple circles/square geometric
 paths are useless(due symmetry), and assymetric(time-wasting)
 paths which target a specific direction are needed.

3.The process of cardinal-direction travel is conceptually simple:
A. You want to gather energies of e.g. East.
B. You will need to avoid travelling West(as it cancels East gains)
C.The path will avoid Westward-travel by adding
 routes which indirectly bring you Westward(diagonally or
 though an angle that is at least 45 deg from West).
 D. Westward travel that cannot be avoided due 
 geographical features is minimized by moving
 sideways and zig-zag maneuvers(that prolong the path
 by not moving directly West).
