A shift to a parallel timeline(parallel world) that is extremely
close, without any major changes.
Its likely such shifts are common, but not recognized:
only after numerous such microshifts,
when a distance from original timeline becomes
noticeable, memories start to conflict with reality(
e.g. "Glitch in the Matrix", "mandela effect").
