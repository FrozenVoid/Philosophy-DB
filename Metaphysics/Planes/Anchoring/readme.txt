Planeshifting is a attachment mechanic that that determines where the being resides and moves:the most attached to plane is "anchored".
Most humans are anchored in the physical plane, a subtle planeshift would move them to a nearby physical plane(a "parallel" world), and death will move them towards etheric and eventually astral plane. There are numerous subplanes and dimensional states/worlds that inhabit the plane system concurrently with human system (planes themself can be moved or shifted in their position:e.g. the physical plane can be moved towards the place of astral plane).
The subtle bodies of physical plane beings can interact with other planes even when the focus isn't on them. Planeshifting alters the relationship between mind and subtle bodies, allow to de-anchor from physical or subtle body: astral/mental projection practice without grounding will eventually weaken the links to physical world.
