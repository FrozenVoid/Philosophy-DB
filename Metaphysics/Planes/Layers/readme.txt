All planes have multiple layers: their
 perception and navigation is sensed by different
 chakras. Even a simple 'physical plane' conventionally
has 'spacetime fabric' layer that is separate
from physical coordinate-space and projection from nearby
planes(e.g.Etheric) are reflected in its layers(
e.g.Real-Time Zone).

A being native in Plane A can sense Plane B
interference and embedded layers in Plane A
which are bound to Plane B will transmit/store/reflect
energy moving in Plane A:
an analogy is 'wires in the walls', that
are normally invisible but transmit energy towards
 areas(thin places/portals/gates) where it 
 interacts with mundane matter(e.g.electricity outlets).
 An entire network of such 'invisible wires/pipes'
 is an 'etheric layer' inside the physical plane.
