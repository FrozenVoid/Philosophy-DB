Roads create an artificial 'ley line' current by etheric
 fields of objects/being movement stirring the ether,
 similar to viscous fluid following the direction of flow.
Roads with heavy traffic create a vaccuum on sides of the road
where ether is pulled into the road channell and pushed with vehicles;
vehicles themselves accumulate heavy ether during movement.

This artificial, confining and draining atmosphere of the road
 environment(automobile roads) 
is negatively felt as "unexplained stress" or dismissed as effect
of road noise(which vibrations do cause harm in separate ways),
the passengers and drivers however are awash with power of 
(heavy, light ether dissipates as water before ships)
ether accumulating in their vehicle as "energy rush" or
in extreme cases "road rage"(excess fire+ether), explaining how
the feeling of "stuck in traffic" feels to drivers used to leech
etheric energy from speedy travel through a road.

Footpaths and bicycle roads have the same overall scheme
as all roads: travelers absorb ether on their path,
stirring a new flow in the road path, building 
an artificial 'ley line' that affects the area(though not 
as bad as vehicle-based roadways due lower speed and volume).

vs Natural 'ley lines':
Natural ley lines follow paths of underground streams,
telluric currents and subtle energy flows that usually don't
have a two-way movement and are not built for geometrical simplicity:
the idea that energy flows towards 'the path of least resistance'
not the 'shortest path', like rivers taking complex curves instead
of geometrically simple channels like roads.
