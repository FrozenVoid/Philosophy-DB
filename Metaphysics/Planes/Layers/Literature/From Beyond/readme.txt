A short story by H.P. Lovecraft where a "mad scientist" creates something
like a brainwave synchronizing machine,(prematurely) activating his
ajna chakra(pineal gland) and transfering his etheric body 
into mid-dimensional state to see (via ESP) realms close 
to lower astral/etheric planes
(i.e. nearby hells or similar less pleasant territories that
negative emotions are most aligned with).
In this mid-dimensional states the 
overlapping dimensions/realms are felt as composed reality
(similar to  interpenetrating layers: etheric planes contain physical)
when all dimensions are seen at once:multi-planar cut of surrounding area.
 This provides "bird eye view" of the interplanar reality.
 H.P. Lovecraft was likely familiar with 
 astral projection and related techniques of
 moving the etheric/astral bodies into this 
 synced-with-mid-dimensional-space(Real-time Zone)
 state(which is quite dangerous as illustrated by the book).
