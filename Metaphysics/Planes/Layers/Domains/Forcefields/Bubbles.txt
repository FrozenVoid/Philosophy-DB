Etheric 'bubbles' are semi-physical barriers of 
domain-type boundary that is externally controlled,
used by aliens/extradimensionals to restrict
movement over an 'bubbled area'.
The etheric plane forcefield that is the energy
source of a bubble cannot(usually) be disabled
by physical means*(however strong rotating EM fields
 might disrupt etheric-physical projection used
 by the bubbler technology).
 
Flying saucer type craft are known to use this
'bubble tech' to restrict access towards their
landing zone, with varying degrees of power:
usually the forcefield acts as "rubber-like air fluid"
rather than a solid barrier.
