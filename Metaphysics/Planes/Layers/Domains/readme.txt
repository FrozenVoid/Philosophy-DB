A domain(planar) is an area segregated from its 
containing plane by artificial means or its structure,
a common type in fiction stories is 
a "pocket dimension"(that isn't a dimension/plane)
or a "bag of holding"(a domain entry object)
where the structure of plane is warped
or shaped(portals) into separate layers from
the normal-Euclidean 1:1 space fabric,
but doesn't connect to another plane:
rather the 'shaped area' of a plane embeds itself
in the super-structure of planar-space fabric subtrate
on higher level(etheric meshes,spacetime,forms)
from the mundane planar (linear) space-time.
