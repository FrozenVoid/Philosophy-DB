A map is a guide that conditions that perception
of underlying plane features and inhabitants.
A map of dreams(dreams are astral plane), 
taken will create an artificial
expectation of similarility which in turn stabilize
the 'Map'(internal map of the world) drawing
one to create new dreams from the 'Map', staying
within its bounds and features.

On the opposite, exploring fictional maps and artificially
created worlds of fantasy allows one to build similar Maps
which allow exploring planar realms that are linked to fictional
material(as all concepts and fantasies have their own 'space' there).

Map and the territory relation is better explained

Maps of physical plane, specifically Earth have 
an utility as ritual pieces or occult items of sympathethic nature,
as they're
symbolically linked to the land they describe:
the map is a collection of egregores:
 nations, water bodies and mountains are all 'entities' of the map
 linked to their location in physical space.
