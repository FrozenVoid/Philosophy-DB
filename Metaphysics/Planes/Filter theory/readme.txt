The answer to "why souls don't all live in higher planes."
The multi-plane system acts as filter to trap souls
in planes corresponding to their lowest vibrations.
From the perspective of outside observer, the planes
are sieves for spiritual evolution - 
keeping souls at place of appropriate level
to their quality(i.e. a level has "Quality Standards"
for souls that act as barriers to entering -
a high-level plane might have mental or moral requirements that souls can't satisfy due corruption of lower planes and have to "level up" in the multi-plane system before being allowed access(psychedelics and 
astral projection are likely the equivalent of drunk tourists breaking in)).
