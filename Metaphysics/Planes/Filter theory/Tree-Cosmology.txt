In tree cosmology planes
are classified as:
A.Trunk plane; mainline plane with
 easy ascent/descent in spiritual terms.
 
B.Branch plane; a plane that 
connects to trunk plane, with
 souls deeper in the branch
focused on some 'branch feature'
that traps them in the plane:
e.g. emotional pleasure in Astral.
