"Energy state analogues"
A nirvanic plane(realm in 'Nirvana' plane)
 is perhaps not able to be expirienced
with human soul machinery due its energy
 thus leading to ' non-conscious expirience'
 where a soul in nirvanic plane(s)
  simply shuts down due overload of energy:
  similar to plane of Asaññasatta 
  where consciousness is limited 
  intentionally for a altered perception
  of fairly mundane, though hi-level plane.,
  
 It is highly likely planes
 exist above/outside nirvanic,
though human perception is not able
to penetrate their true nature,
like e.g. a deeply sedated patient has
no true ability to sense his environment
 only vague perceptions and drug sensations.
