Astral plane governs emotional-astral
 energy, thereby being a central
 resource hub for planar entities
 feeding on it - and its continuing
 importance in relation to 'higher' planes.
 
 Astral plane permeates all senses 
 of Desire realm from most basic
 enjoyement of feeding to abstract
 mental satisfaction of deducing a solution.
 The refinement of emotion/feeling
 depends on astral(Air element) energy,
 as well as all creative efforts.
 
 Intellectual advancement is not
 purely mental and is driven
 by Astral energy flows that 
  are essential for focusing on
  a subject and forming interest
  in a topic, with desire to
 research, invent and surpass the
 status quo inherently emotional-astral
 foundation to 'cold' mental plane
 calculations and 'unemotional' 
 rational(mental) reasoning.
 
 Astral plane is visited in dreams
 where entire realms are fed by
 desires of dreamers and astral
 projectors(who are not in control,
 as they think), converting
  physical(Earth/Water) energy
 into astral(Air)/etheric(Ether)
 forms.
 
 Etheric plane can be considered
  a sibling of Astral that is 
  bound with Physical in a stable
  manner, i.e. grounded to Earth,
 with Astral entities able to
  travel in ether(except in water)
  , while Etherics
 could travel in physical(though
 entities are often bound to their
 'range' and cannot leave).
