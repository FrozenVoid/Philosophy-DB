A belief in any fiction will
shape your mental plane space.
Practice mental hygiene and avoid
 mass-belief objects of fiction
 where you will have less control.
Mental plane has a property 
of effectively shaping to your
 expectations and desires,
with perceptions entirely constructed
by expectation of 'default' content.

i.e. fiction will shape your
mental expectation sphere that
will make it into mental plane
spaces.
