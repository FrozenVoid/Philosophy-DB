a formless realm-type world doesn't necessary have
objects/subjects that are "formless"(no visuals) rather the mental appearance
of the object changes chaotically dependent on perspective and energy:
its form rapidly adapts to observer desires, biases and expectations.
Entirely formless objects as feeling/concept are features at hi-level
planes where physical perception(visual/audio/tactile) doesn't work or
requires extra-sensory perception to recognize.
