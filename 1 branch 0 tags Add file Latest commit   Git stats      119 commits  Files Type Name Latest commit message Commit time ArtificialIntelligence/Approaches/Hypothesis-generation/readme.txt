The path to super-intelligence seems to require independent thought-generation
of which forming a hypothesis about the world and researching it.
An AI should be able to form hypothesis about its reality model,
apply it to data and infer some conclusion, without such hypothesis
 being pre-programmed or input into it.
Hypothesis generator is an idea of forming an active
 "Exploration module" in AI which tries to search for valid ideas
from hypothesis-space and either confirm/deny the hypothesis.
Key problems:
Determining how hypothesis-space is constructed from reality-model:
How would an AI form questions: AI would be likely focused on determining
 missing/incomplete/vague data in the reality model - focus must be
on exploring creative/conceptual investigation of reality not data search.
How would the AI test validity of hypothesis pattern:
Will it learn validity by expiriment or simulation?
Will some algorithm/network/module required weed out invalid hypothesis forms using
formal logic(logical fallacies that will be easy for AI) and ethics-based reasoning
(that would be harder but will avoid AI exploring unethical ideas).

This functionality would create a core on which independent thought 
can be projected: the AI would actually "think for itself" instead of being
 a problem-solving device.
