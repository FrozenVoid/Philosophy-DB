Solving climate change with trees:

The basic idea here is to create a genetically/selectively modified tree species
with the following characteristics:
1.A wood that is invulnerable to logging,rot, animals and insects.
A high-density 'iron tree', that could be only cut with high-end tech like lasers
or specialized tools. Nano-structures and density could
be tuned to maximize tree survival over time - avoiding rot and mechanical damage both from inside and externally.

2.Tree bearing nuts with high economic/nutritional value, giving a stimulus to 
its existence from average consumer. An algae equivalent nutrition profile,
would allow it to be planted as staple crop by farmers.

3.A high resistance to drought and heat, two of predicted consequences of GW to survive future climate.
A cold resistance would allow to plant it in high-latitudes as bonus, reaching
 areas currently lacking forests and drawing in massive CO2 generated by methane/CO2 releases
 as they happen locally.
 
4.A large size of tree trunk, maximizing volume over height to store captured 
 carbon. This is crucial idea - trees will be planted to maximize volume of carbon capture 
  per area, with thick trunk,roots and branches.
