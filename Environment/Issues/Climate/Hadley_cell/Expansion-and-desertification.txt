Due climate change processes,
the current weather system 
Hadley cells will expand and
eventually merge when overlapping
cells occur.

The global weather effects
of this is completely ignored
in favor of simplistic 
"temperature changes +/-" when in
fact entire Climate zones will
mutate to new forms.

Precipation pattern:
Hadley cells are especially important
 due agriculture dependence on
natural irrigation(i.e. rain/snow),
as described in the above article,
with climate turning to desert
type zone, soil depletion will
intensify and reduce global crop
 supplies, with no alternative as
any other growing area will
not absorb the demand.
