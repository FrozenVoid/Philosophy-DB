Due the resource consumption of non-renewables, the humanity
is destined either to:
A.Consume non-renewable resources to the limit and collapse without switching
to alternative resource types.
B.Switch to alternative resource types.

B implies an industrial/technological level that is 
only available in a short time-frame where resources are plentiful.
Without access to abudant resources, high-level technology for 
producing tools/devices/systems that work with renewables will be
impossible or very slow to undertake.

This means, that humanity has one-shot chance to switch to
new resource system before economic forces(price of resources)
make it prohibitively expensive and rare: i.e. to maintain current
level of technology it is required a certain level of energy/resource
input. Without this level, civilization reverts to earlier forms
of social structures and communication, that would not be conductive to
developing renewables energy/resources(e.g. solar power).

To produce a single solar panel, a wind/water turbine, requires
a implicit level of high-end production and technology:
While cost of renewables would be lower than non-renewables,
producing the devices will require a background level of resources/energy
to jump-start renewable technology - without prior resources,
there is simply no way to transition the economy towards that path;
i.e. cost of renewables is irrelevant when you lack means to produce
 devices for them. 

The main implication is that non-renewables are a dead-end path that
 leads to technological stagnation and decline as cost of non-renewables
 rises with time and effort required, though the process might take 
centuries until depletion of resource(like e.g. coal) - making future
humanity resource reserves practically non-existant, which in case of economic collapse(brought by end of cheap non-renewables or climate change) would be unable to reach technological level of 20th century.
