27.6C vs 25C

The common wisdom of setting air conditioning
to 25C is wrong: it wastes enormous amounts of electricity
while temps of about 27.6C is far more comfortable
for human metabolism. 25C would makes sense 
if hard work is constantly performed in some warehouse
but office/home setting of 25C is excessively wasteful and
above 28.5C creates extra heat stress during any work.

 


health aspects:
the conventional 25C "room temp" default is not 
even followed in some settings as people set it even lower,
at some point causing hypothermic conditions in vehicles/buildings
at hot weather: the constant contrast between
near 20C conditioning and outside (~30C) creates an
additional stress factor on cardiovascular system.



Artificial Winter: each degree of cooling below 27.6C will
cause the human body to expend much more
energy(as it typically does in winter) shifting the immune
system closer to "winter mode"(reduced effect).


Disadaptation: Humans living in full air-conditioned space
 reduce their adaptive heating/cooling capacity for 
   climate,narrowing their comfort range
(usually centered on 27.6C - dependent on degree of infflamation).
