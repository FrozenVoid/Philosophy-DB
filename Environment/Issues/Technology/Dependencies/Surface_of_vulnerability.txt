Surface(and minimization thereof)
of vulnerability is an category
of technological devices(e.g.
electric wires) that create a hard 
dependency without alternatives
(e.g.electric system blackouts)
when devices are required for
 daily life, where failure in
the system lowers quality of life
significantly or even causes deaths.
The artificial nature of 
human habitation and
its dependencies are illustrated
best in the novel "The Machine Stops"

Minimizing the surface:
1.Alternative technologies/solutions.
2.Increasing reliability of
 technology: decentralization,
 removal of inter-dependent parts,
 self-healing systems and automatic
 repair.
3.Fail-safe design: fallback
solutions and risk reduction measures.
