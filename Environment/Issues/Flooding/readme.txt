Flooding can be defined as sudden, uncontrolled displacement of water.
Factors encouraging flooding:
1.Lack of runoff canals, streams, outlets in the flooded terrains:
Water choose the path of least height: if canals and streams
 don't provide a low path, the water will carve its own.
Shallow streams/canals lack volume: they can't handle excess water.
Shallow streams/canals lack strong banks: their borders are eroded easily by mass of water.

2.Damming of upstream reservoirs with narrow escape paths for water:
a narrow path equates to a bottleneck creating potent streams(used for electricity generation).
Damming forces water underground, weakening the soil above:
if all paths are blocked the water carves its own underground.
The problem of containing vast volumes of water cannot be solved
long-term without completely artificial reservoirs(e.g. steel),
as soil/ground cannot be relied on completely and eventually erodes around the dam.

3.Deforestation: dense forest cover soaks groundwater, preventing
 quicksand/swamp condition from overwatered soil(less water->stiff soil, more water -> weak soil-> quick erosion). Water table is controlled by forest
cover: without it, the water table will rise proportional to amount of incoming water until it spills overground.

4.Soil erosion: weak(esp.sandy), crumbling soil is easily swept by flooding.
Flooding acquires its potency due weak soil, lack of outlets and narrow paths. Gravel, stones, basalt/granite reduce potency of flooding.
