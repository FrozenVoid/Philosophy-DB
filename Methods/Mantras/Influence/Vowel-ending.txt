Vowel-ending mantras, or open-channel mantras,
will flood the nearby area with the element of terminal vowel.
Usually this action, will deplete the element expelled(unless 
excess of it is generated) but create a field around aura of
this energy(dependent on chakra strength).
Such mantras are primary way to affect the external
environment, vs consonant terminals which only apply
effect in external way through accumulated chanting merit(
i.e. vowel ending mantras work instantly).

Example: HA mantra which expels fire and depletes ether,
is an instant stress relief, which drains 'etheric heaviness'(
however overuse also drains etheric body substrate),
so the mantra is better suited for short-term chanting
for tactical benefit.
