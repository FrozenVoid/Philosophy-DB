the flow of elemental energy in the mantra can be
of several directions, but is usually;
a.Upward flow: lower chakras to top chakras(third eye/crown, projection state)
b.Downward flow: upper chakras to lower chakras(grounding state).
Some mantras create a more complex flow(or a loop),
where energy is re/cycled through a line of chakras:
such mantras are classified by their initial letter(start chakra).
