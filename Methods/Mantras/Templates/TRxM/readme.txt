TRxM where x is/are vowels,is
a template of transformation mantra
used for advanced practices:
TR- prefix is refined Fire set
to energize specific element(s).
Why are they powerful?(Ether-Fire)
Flow->T=Ether gathered to purify
R=Fire,Manipura energy sent to
x=Vowel(s) elemental channels arrive at
M=Third Eye terminal(Fire+Element)

Note: Initial T will deplete willpower/ether
, specificially in chest area.
This is compensated by Fire in
some cases(non-kapha vowels) 
and RHxM type healing mantras(
which do the opposite
Fire(R)-Ether(H) flow )
