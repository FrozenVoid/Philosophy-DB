The template uses chakra bija-mantra{LAM,VAM,RAM,YAM,HAM,KSHAM,AUM}
and another bija-mantra(usually a chakra petal mantra)
example;
YAM(heart core)+TAM(manipura petal)
The latter stabilizes/transforms the core element used by chakra
which prevents element overload that occurs if chakra bija-mantras
is used exclusively.
