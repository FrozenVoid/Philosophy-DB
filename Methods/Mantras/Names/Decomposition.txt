the flow of a word can be decomposed with mantra
analysis:
defining terms:
1.Initial/starter: first phoneme
this is the source of word's energy and will be depleted.

2.Middle channels; vowels in the middle, corresponding to their elements.
The opened channels define which type of energy is moved as capability:
e.g. a ROM activates earth channel, while RAM activates fire channel.
Consonant-only words don't move energy but will modulate
the environment flows as is(i.e. adding vectors/stops to existing
flows in nearby area).

3.Middle stops: consonants that modulate/filter the flow.
these are the refined aspects of longer words,which can
be considered as sub-components filtering the flow or stopping it:
some effects of words are entirely due stopping elemental flows
in the middle(acting as another terminal letter) and a weak terminal
that absorbs the rest of energy.

4.Terminal stop:terminal letter on which the energy is focused.
The letter is energized and its elements are increased.
