the pattern of entity/concept name, reversed is used to
alienate/sever/disrupt its influence by counter-current of opposite energy pattern.
While the elements of the pattern are the same,
their invocation as 'reverse mantra' turns the entity/concept 
into its opposite
e.g. love(phonetically 'lav') ->val( 'wall').
