A shared egregore or rarely tulpa of a name,
is the words natural energy pattern manifested as entity, said by millions of users.
This word chanting/spelling/mental conjuring creates a steady flow
of energy towards the formation of tulpa and later egregore
that feeds on the word being said.

example: 'Apple' conjures in the mind associations of an apple,
however the word itself is also charged by Apple-brand fans refering
to computers to combine into an egregore with features of both
apples and Apple computers, as energy pattern is the same.
