I is water channel, River of life,
and is connected to lower etheric
'Vital body' which is the direct
 interface for all subtle bodies
and attached entites.
Sacral chakra, blood and vitality
/health are dependent on this channel.
Mental lucidity/Mindfulness, etheric
 purity(water cleanses ether) and
 raw sense perception requires
this channel, thus the amount
of mantras with(-IM) as suffix.
