A pacifying mantra inserted before another bija-mantra,
in order to control its fire/vata energy.
related to SHRIM(lunar heart mantra).

Note:This is extreme Yin prefix that reduces
freewill and induces passivity(Yin/Kapha/Earth)
that allows external circumstances and entities
to 'lead the way' - Shri-prefixed mantras are
essentially surrendering to fate and path of least resistance(extreme lunar).
