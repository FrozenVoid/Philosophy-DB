Most popular mantra, Earth element.
Elements: Earth, water/ether(third-eye)
OM stabilizes, cools and calms down the mind(grounding).
Used for meditation, anti-infflamation, general health.
Side effects; Cold, fire element reduction.

vs AUM: aum is the opposite(Fire+ether mantra) that energizes
and uplifts(however increases Yang energy substantially).

OOMM... forms:
chanting the long-form 'oOOMMMMMMm..' activates both pathways,
with OO transforming to O-negated(earth-depleting,fire-rising/ether-increasing as in O-OM sounding like OWM/aum ) 
which combines with earth-channel to create a multi-elemental 
flow to the third-eye terminal M(which activation is enchanced by
 prolonged concentration on M-sound).
