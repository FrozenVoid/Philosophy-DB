AM is associated with buddhist concept of sambodhi.
In the Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra the four basic variations on the letter a (ie a ā aṃ aḥ) are linked to the four stages of practice: bodhi, carya, saṃbodhi, nirvaṇa. These are sometimes pictured as a maṇḍala with the four syllables combined as āṃḥ in the centre.
AM(fire-rising, energy intensification,speed and power, yang) is anti-thesis to OM(earth-centering, grounding,slow and calm,yin) - with both of mantras creating
a direct path towards either extreme yang or yin states(which is useful for prefixing before another mantra e.g. AM RHIM).
