-M ending mantra, m=third eye
M terminal focuses energy towards the third eye,ajna chakra.
It is a fairly common ending in mantras which require concentration, as M
 energizes ajna and consequently the mind.
vs -NG;
an alternative ending is -NG(crown) which reduces infflamation
from M-ether channel, though it requires control of emotions(i.e. swapping xx-M to xx-NG has some tradeoffs, with -NG increasing sensitivity and energy flow terminals in the crown(brain) maybe overwhelming).
