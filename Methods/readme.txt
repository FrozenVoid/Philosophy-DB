Metaphysical and mundane methods to control and influence
 life, its expirience and flow.
Philosophy as it understood by masses is passive mental
analysis aking to textual criticism and literary analysis,
but that excludes applied philosophy: methods and practices.

While theory is the basis for most of methods,
philosophy doesn't exclude non-empirical/non-material justification
for exploring reality and its component's relations:
that would be science, which can be considered an extension of
logical/empirical inquiry, a method which is currently
dominated by 'Scientific method' theory
that excludes applied metaphysics, spirituality and ESP.
