An instrument effect will be dependent on its
material and construction type:
Vibration/resonance, percussion/impact 
or air-movement modulation.

Vata instruments: instruments which are Vata
are usually Vibration/air-modulation based,
complex and require much skill to operate,
with violins being example of refined Vata energy.


Kapha instruments: such instruments create a big
and profound movement of energy like an earthquake,
usually in the bass range. 
An organ is a typical Kapha instrument.

Pitta instruments: such instruments are defined
by constant rhythmic expression, regardless of material:
Pitta instruments are meant to be in constant, material-wearing
action until the music stops, e.g. drums.
