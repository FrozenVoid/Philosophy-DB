Loop method is using a single musical composition,
or more efficiently a limited sample(hook/refrain/main melody)
played in a loop to induce an emotional/mental state which will be used 
as basis for meditation/projection/introspection.
Unlike binaural beats, complex pieces don't create tolerance 
or adaptation(except for really small segments) due diversity
of employed frequencies - however with more frequencies the effect is dulled.
