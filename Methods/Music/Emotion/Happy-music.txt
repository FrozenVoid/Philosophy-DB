Uplifting/Happy music that is mostly described as such 
is actually vata music in disguise,
with melancholic capacity reduced, that way it doesn't invoke
refined emotions right away, instead opting for simpler rhythm of 
Earth-type music and cheerful vocals in calm, slow composition.
Earth-Air music combination will eventually lead to Air-type
state where all positive emotion is refined and somewhat corrupted
due Earth-type not able to represent emotion clearly, leading
to phenomenon of "Happy music causing sadness(melancholy actually)".

Actual 'happy music' is temporary and subjective expirience that
usually occurs due listening to Earth-type music with
energetic undertones of Fire-type, 
that is more 'uplifting/energizing' than happy.
