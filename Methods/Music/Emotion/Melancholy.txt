Music often evokes the emotion of melancholy due several causes:
1. Music inherently depends on memory to deliver emotional depths.
Such memory is often negatively-shaded due material plane quality.

2. Music that is slow & relaxed engages the depressive aspects of
awake delta rhythm in the brain: the sleep-like quality of slow melodies
 often evokes long-lasting downshifting in mood & indifference towards 
 world which transforms into melancholy with inward focus.
 
 3. Melancholy is easily achieved with lone instrument compositions
  as opposed to polyphonic sounds: the sense of solitude & centrality of single
   melody often draws similar emotions as introspective expirience:
   the meditative focusing on singular rhythm activates upper chakras.
   
 4.Music forces one to confront inner emotional world: vata-centric and rich
  in melancholy, self-pity and ego-centric focus of material suffering.
Instead of viewing music as pure art, music is viewed as deep entertainment
 that aids self-discovery, that inevitably engages melancholy as primary conduit
  to the musical introspection - opening the emotional channels.
  
  5.Material plane existence is inherently filled with suffering which
   music uncovers in expressing this mood externally, as internal emotions
   are simply brought to surface: the melancholy is not within music 
   as it appears but within the mind, with 'sad music' connecting up astral-level(emotional) memories
   with mental expiriences as crystallized emotion
   (memory linked with music+emotion: the emotional memory component is activated
    by music & mental by content of past memory).
