Music fasting or music avoidance is used to remove
influence of musical vibrations on chakras(usually heart/throat),
since music primary effect is etheric/astral vibration syncing.

Music addiction/dependence result from energetic weakness
in chakras which are overstimulated by musical rhythms that resonate
on chakra specific frequency, the result being similar
to coffee stimulation, 
requiring more volume and time to boost chakra activity:
music fans often search for more stimulation from novel
 patterns that their chakras are not used to to overstimulate
 their activity.

Some music attracts astral parasites and demonic entities,
which attach to chakra emanating vibrations in tune of specific
music: the parasite/entity will stimulate consumption of that music
 leading to people listening to it on repeat to recreate
 the pattern which the parasite likes(the parasites
 often reward their victim by stimulation of brain pleasure areas
 or chakra's etheric channel connected to nerve system
 giving a state of "musical euphoria"/"chills"/"ASMR").


It a mistake to think all music as evil,
but most human music is spiritually corrupted with
lower chakra vibrations dominating:
music exists
on most planes as 'vibration patterns'(energy vibration)
 our music
is simply Material Plane Music(from animal songs to classic symphonies)
which may have a similarity to higher-plane music like
a view of higher planes can reflected in art:
in many cases people spiritual growth can be stimulated
by refined music, even if they lack spiritual focus -
music can serve as escape from purely material focus.



Some meditation music/binaural beats/pure tones
are exempt from such practice to aid meditation/focus/spiritual states.
