shaking or whole-body vibration is a potent method to cleanse subtle bodies,
readjust chakras and activate/clear/energize kundalini flows.
Also helps with muscle growth and healing. The system its parts is called
Trauma-Release Exercise, because it releases psychological tensions.
Method:
1.In a lying position put legs up and hold until muscle exhausting begins.
(alternatively put hands up vertically for x5 time: the idea is to cause muscle exhaustion and tremors).
2.wait out for shaking, then try to hold at least 1 min(for hands: try longer periods)
