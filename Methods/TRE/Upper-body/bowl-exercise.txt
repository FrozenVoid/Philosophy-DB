this TRE method activates upper body muscles:
1.Grab a metallic bowl by its sides in both hands.
2.Attempt to 'separate the bowl' by pulling its sides apart
(its presumed the bowl is rigid enough to resist this).
3.Muscle shaking will start shortly as continued
pressures from pulls on both hands will add fatigue.
