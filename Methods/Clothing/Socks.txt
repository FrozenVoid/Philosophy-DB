Socks are the primary filter
for incoming underground/earth energy.
White or bright colors will allow
filtering most of this energy.

Earth circuits in soles of feet,
have to be protected by footwear and socks
as unconstrained, the grounding and interaction
will waste energy with local environment:
this creates an energy deficit in most cases
(in rare cases, telluric currents and charged
 areas from crowds may create surplus energy)
