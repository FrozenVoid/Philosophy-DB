Clothing supresses and modulates the flow of chakra channels.
Clothing color defines which external energies will be
accessible or pass through it, as clothing is an energetic barrier
defined by its color and density.
Parameters of clothing:
1.Density/gaps: Amount of air that is passing through.
The quality of clothing as energetic armor is defined by
the density of material and lack of gaps.

2.Color: which energies are filtered out and absorbed.
The color which is reflected(color of item) is filtered out.
Black absorbs all colors(trap), white reflects all(mirror).

3.Closeness: how close is the clothing to skin.
Closer clothing reduces air-space between skin-clothing,where
astral entities can attach but also forces more interaction
with nearby chakras, effectively replacing skin.
