Reality check is a method to discern where you're located:
The goal is to distinguish between Physical reality and everything else(lucid dreams, astral, etc).
Effective checks:
1.Gravity: In lucid dreams, most astral locations, gravity is nominal.
By stretching on your hands(e.g. holding a rail) and trying to "hold position" the gravity check yields the physics constraints, with semi-levitation inplace in dream/astral.
2.Visual: By closing/blinking eyes the world starts to changes: unstable reality or dream.
3.Memory: if you can't recall how you got there, its likely not physical.
Try to recall the day events, major facts.
4.Focus: by focusing on objects they morph.
5.Info stability check: if location has clocks or books/papers/computers, their content can change between looking at them and to other objects.
6. Consistency check: are your thoughts consistent or emotional responses? Emotional rollecoasters and illogical thoughts are astral plane phenomenona.
7.Expectation and power of will: Check that your pocket is empty.
 pretend you have a coin in your empty pocket and put your hand in, if there is something, you're not in physical. "Reality follows expectation" is a common character of most astral/mental locations.
8.Sound: Try to create any sound without talking. If you fail or the sound sounds weird, its a sign of non-physical reality(astral mostly has low audio realism)
