Wim Hof method is simplified Tummo meditation(pranayama centric method)
technique to maximize the fire element in the body(raising temperature(inner fire) , metabolism and stress hormones). The limit of temp increase is ~40C and body gradually adapts to thermal stress/heat(with increased energy benefits remaining).

Such pranayama techniques are very "unbalancing"(eqv to practicing Surya mudra or any fire-element booster mudra for extended periods of time) for the mind and the survival-mode it enters is counterproductive to calm introspection of samatha meditation. Immune function will be reduced by continued practice that creates artificial inflammation.
Visualization of fire(fire element) on central chakras may create an overabudance of fire energy(can be removed with prithvi mudra).
