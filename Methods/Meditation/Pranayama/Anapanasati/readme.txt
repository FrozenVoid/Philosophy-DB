Anapanasati is mindfullness of breathing, a form of meditation and pranayama practice.
Mastering Anapanasati unlocks insight and control of energy flows and mental streams which are sustained by them - the focus on breathing gradually shifts on mental/energetic components of breath and the mind-stream itself. 
Energy flows in the vata and pitta humor intensify (Air+Ether,Fire+Water) - the chakras have limits on how much energy flow the body can handle(however the practicioner of Anapanasati does not and can damage them easily with too much forceful breathing and intense control of process).

Buddhists view Anapanasati as quickest path to Nirvana and it was used by Gautama  himself to reach it the first time.

Combination with Mantras: exhalation and/or inhalation focusing are aided by chanting mentally the appropriate mantra.
