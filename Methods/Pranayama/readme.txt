Pranayama a yogic breathic discipline also used in meditative practices.
It usually results in 'wind sicksness' or Air element overload, in most people as
 Air element raises emotional sensitivity to level of psychosis.
 This is obviously a self-destructive practice that has a very narrow
  utility in any spiritual system, as the energy level it generates is out 
  of normal human capacity to contain in the body - its magical use is to
  give life(pneuma) or summon new entity into physical domain.

How it works:
It creates a tulpa from focusing on breath as entity moving through your body,
 and uses that tulpa as focus object to merge mindstream with it.
 The 'breath' is actually filled with pranic energy and is extremely easy to mold
 into any tulpa/servitor entity, but no pranayam apracticioner will tell you that:
 it 'mystery' and 'enlightment' comes from opening mind to pure vata energy('breath of life')
 that is Air element power = Astral energy field and consequently astral projection.
 All tulpas created with pranayama are powerful entities, which will not be easily
  controlled by a human with weak willpower(especially high on air based vata-humor):
"giving breath" is what is used to give life to objects, that is pranic life-energy of magician 
 focused with intent towards a projected entity.
