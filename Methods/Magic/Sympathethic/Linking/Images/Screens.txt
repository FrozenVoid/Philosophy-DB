Touching screen images
(including sigils,unicode character symbols,charged/shaped text),
with your fingers(which are elemental channels),will link
elemental energy channels to the object depicted.
e.g. touching an image of 'fictional' entity with index finger on
the screen.


Images on non-screen surfaces are unique objects with separate
links/channels that depend on their substrate material,
but a screen is a 'pure channel'(like a scrying tool)
evoking a mental
circuit that is substrate-independent(because the image is virtual).
