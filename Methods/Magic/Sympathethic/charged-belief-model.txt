a charged belief model is as follows;
1.the magician force a consistent belief in some
fictional/fantasy concept.
2.the belief is charged by energy and repetition
of its content in the mind.
3.the belief is actulized by linking it to reality,
giving a pathway of change from reality to belief("magical thinking").

Effectively, the belief is used as tool of sympathethic
magic, charging the thought-form into realizing itself(actualization).
