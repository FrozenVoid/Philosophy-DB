A word purpose is sympathethically linked with its
effect.The energy pattern of the word, through
centuries of repetition must be holding a mantra-like
qualities, both mental and energetic imprint of its purpose.
e.g.the word CURE is linked with curing/removing disease,
like a mantra chanting the word would activate sympathethically
the inner energy of 'CURE' to manifest.
