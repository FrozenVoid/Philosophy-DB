Fantasy is a basis for construction of sympathethic construct set
which will be empowered by focusing and repeating the fantasy,
allowing its contents to manifest.

Most people have their mental energies locked in various
 fantasies with detrimental effects, as their conflicts(fantasy
 A vs fantasy B), quality(fantasy is always better)  
 and disattachment with the real world(anything you like)
 draws one into
 charging the fantasy scenario(feeding a 'tulpa wonderland')
 that cannot manifest and encourages patterns of derealization
 to preserve its own existence as 'fantasy entity'
 that is enthusiastically worshipped
 by its owner(similar to tulpamancy 'forcing pattern').
