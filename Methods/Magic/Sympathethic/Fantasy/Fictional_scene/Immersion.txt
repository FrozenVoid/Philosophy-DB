Immersion in a fictional medium
is itself a form of sympathethic
magic linking the mind with 
the fantasy scenario.
The dangers of 'immersing oneself'
in scenarios one has no control 
of(e.g. mass produced fiction) are
similar in principle to allowing
 religious cult influence or
 ideological subversion.

Why immersion is magical:
Mental body does not require
a 'physical substrate' to align
with(real vs abstract object), allowing pure mental constructs
 and charged thoughtforms to
serve as 'mental environment components',
