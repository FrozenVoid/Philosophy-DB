What happens:
A fictional scene from visual
or (more rarely) textual medium
is brought to the target mind,
the scene can be charged by 
curse/spell/link to its creators
(not necessary human), which when
repeated in mind provides access
to the mental payload of scene
in the mind: i.e. specific pattern
 embedded in the fictional scene
 is injected into the mind.

Why this works:
The mental repetition of a process/evokation
 of a fictional scene, is like a 
 videogame player focusing on
 specific task - charging the scene
 and connecting with its embedded patterns,
 as mental body absorbs and realigns
 itself with the scene.
 
What is a valid scene:
A visual scene or detailed textual description
of scene/picture, video/animated sequence,
,etc allowing
the viewer to 'merge with the fantasy'
by imagination/suspension of disbelief
(e.g. videogame trance/cinematic immersion).

Memetic: 
memetic scenes which the viewer
aligns themself have especially
potent effect as the charged
 meme egregore will link to its
 adherents astral body by emotional
 rapport established with the meme.
