sympathetic magic is a belief system where a representation of a entity is connected to the entity, and that action on the representation will affect the original entity. The roots of belief come from worship of idols as representing gods and spirits, where each offering or offense against the idol counts as offering/offense to the god/spirit represented. These belief manifests in tulpas, such that idols worshiped are tulpa/egregore bound to object and not actual entity being worshiped, essentilly a spirit existing on the energy of worshiping people.

Modern beliefs in voodoo dolls and western magical tradition of curses/hexes/black magic, bases off the idea that linking of entities to objects gives power to owner of the objects due material or representational link(such e.g. strand of hair, photo,cloth). These ideas don't actually manifest without a conscious energy transfer from the magician to the object and creating magician-object-target channel(which explains why "curses" return back to the sender) or even magician-target channel(where object serves as linking memory device or target for tulpa manifestation as outlined in the above idol example).
