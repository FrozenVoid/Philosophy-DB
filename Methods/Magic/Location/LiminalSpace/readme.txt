Liminal spaces, boundaries signify a change in energy, like moving from water into air.
1.Each room, road, building, wall, has a distinct elemental composition
and energy flow.
2.At the boundary of areas, the energies combine or repel each other.
3.The liminal space is the area of expansion and external influence:
by deliberately staying inside the liminal space the energies of distinct
areas can be induced to combine in a human circuits of chakras.
4.Liminal space vs internal space: internal space in the area is grounded
and stable(in most cases).
Liminal space is energetic(boundary flow), chaotic(external influence) and dynamic(frontier energy)
5.At edge of each area, door,border its possible to harness
global flows which pass through the areas or boundaries between,
without being affected by egregores governing the areas(e.g. building spirit).
6.Energy flows which are repelled by internal-area energy(Nexus of power),
tend to curve around the area using its boundary(liminal space).
