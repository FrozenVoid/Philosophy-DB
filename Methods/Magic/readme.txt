Magic is a theory of energy/thought manipulation to
achieve various goals 'magically'(without required effort).
Magic can be divided into following forms:

1.Elemental: elemental magic manipulates the primary elements,
their flows and combinations to force new energy configurations.
An example is mudras for specific element.
In fiction and video games, the 'elemental' magic 
is actually summoning of elemental entities to do specific tasks,
which is properly 'Summoning' type magic: the
'fireball' is not cast from thumb's limited fire channel,
but is a summoned elemental entity that has its own subtle body
and its own mind, not a cloud of dumb plasma shot out and discarded.

2.Sympathethic: linking objects/events/mental forms
with each other to create specific changes in a target.
More broadly thoughtforming and fantasy are forms 
of sympathethic magic(usually enchantment).
Rituals of imitation, connection and binding are common
themes in such magic domain, but any ritual with intent is
effectively sympathethic("magical thinking"):
Sigils/runes/inscriptions are form of written sympathethic
magic that is charged towards their purpose.
Curses and hexes are negative sympathethic spells linking
events/entities with their victims.

3.Summoning:from tulpaforcing to ritual invocations,
this types of magic bring entities from nearby or connected
planes into etheric plane of Earth. This is most
versatile and dangerous type of magic as entities summoned down can
have their own magical abilities and powers.
All summoning-type spells usually require a connection
to an already formed entity(even tulpaforcing requires
some 'astral energy clouds' entities) and means to bring
it towards the target object or magician, usually
by a binding spell.


4.Psionics: psionic abilities are natural 'siddhi' powers
that can be developed to affect physical/etheric changes.
Such powers are granted with yoga/meditative practice at
specific advancements(e.g. kundalini activation) dependent on
capabilities of the 'siddhi' owner - they are not granted
via practice or imaginary exercises in futility.
Example of such powers is telekinesis and telepathy.

5.Alchemy: Alchemy is manipulation of matter to
create specific elemental/spiritual/mental conditions
in the magician or environment. For example turning wood into
chairs is (broadly speaking) tranformative alchemy,
though the alchemist would create a 'magical chair' with 
specific ritual and method.
Alchemy is culturally connected with potion-making and
use of psychedelic plants/fungi, as its its most famous subset.
The ideas of chemistry evolved from transformative alchemical research.
Amulets and charms are not necessary from alchemical magic, but
their operation is connected to 'alchemical power' charged
 into matter(elemental energy/entities) that can be destroyed
 by material counter(like fairies and cold iron).

6.Divination: prediction or discerment of future/fate
of some subject. The method can involve chance, scrying,
divinatory ritual or spell resulting in information 
that will be interpreted
as prediction by a diviner, typically using a linking guide/chart/table
that connects subjects with their effects.
Astrology and tarot cards are the most famous forms.

7.Technomancy: use of technology to create
an altered state of mind via brainwave entrainment,
intense attention(focus) and biofeedback devices. 
Unlike alchemy there is 
no magical expertise or proficiency required.
More broadly the use of substances, mundane actions, drugs and devices
with the intent to create a magical environment or
state of mental projection.

Technomancy rituals and spells are pervasive
and not noticeable to everyday reality:
A person playing a video game killing a demon,
two people cursing at each
other on a public forum, a person lifestreaming
some activity, where focused energy is spent
charging tulpas and egregores inside a shared
virtual world. 

The concepts of "suspension of disbelief"
,"virtual reality","immersion" and "magical realism"
are in effect altered states of mind that
leaves one open to mental projection and invocation
of powerful spells/rituals without any clue to their nature:
the state of mindless activity is actually very 'mindful'
focused meditative practice(albeit in a corrupted form:
forcing an energy pattern/reconfiguration 
by repetition like a mantra) equivalent to repeatedly 
performing a ritual.
The undeveloped subtle bodies of most humans cannot
usually tap into their technomancy-induced trance energy
but will be addicted to the virtual rush of elemental
 flows induced from engaging with it: video game
 addiction is fundamentally a dissociative mental projection
 state that is broadly equivalent to 'active focus meditation'.
 
 Social networking is a magical lens that focuses energies
 of thousands on specific objects/subjects bringing
 forth their tulpa-forms or even creating powerful egregores
 that will termed an 'internet hive-mind' bound to its creators.
