Red is the root chakra color, it is a powerful grounding channel
for Earth energy. Wearing red clothes/items will ground your etheric body.
Red has some anti-magic properties which may serve as protective
 layer by emanating stabilizing Earth elemental flow: however this will reduce
  available energy. Red counters Fire/Ether elemental attacks best:
  Water-based elemental energy can be even amplified(due Earth-Water connection 
  By kapha humor).
