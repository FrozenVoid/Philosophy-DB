Color and reflected light have a hidden metaphysical effect which
depends on the chakra/body part they represent:
Items with the specific color attract and reflect energies corresponding
to that color. By choosing colors and arranging their configurations
its possible to manipulate energy flows in an area(usually reflecting energies
 of specific color e.g. blue)

examples:
Black - lower feet, underworld, darkness, night
Brown - feet, earth, soil, Earth 
Red - Root Chakra, Primal instincts, Matter, blood, Earth element
Orange - Sacral chakra, Raw emotion, sexuality, fluid/Water element
Yellow - Manipura/Solar Chakra, Fire, Energy flow, Action and karma
Green - Heart chakra, refined emotions, love and empathy, focused mind
Blue - Throat chakra, voice,etheric  power, control and social status, purity of mind
Violet - Third eye, psionics, knowledge, intellectual power, mental planes
White - Crown, higher consciusness, soul power, cosmic forces, mental/causal planes
there are other colors imperciptible to vision that have
chakras above crown correspondence(like a line of chakras following the spine channel),
but the area is above visible light: these colors would be
 exceptionally bright(e.g. ultra-violet) and biologically harmful to 'see' through.
Infrared and sub-infrared(terahertz) have correspondence with chakra lines below
 feet and coonecting to various underworld realms(including hells and demonic realms).
