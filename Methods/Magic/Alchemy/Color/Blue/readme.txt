Blue (color of throat chakra, water and purity) is used to repel evil forces,
as with colors higher than blue in frequency(e.g. violet).
Blue amplifies qualities of Ether: voice, willpower, expands etheric aura space. Blue will amplify Fire/Air elemental flows in some degree,
due synergy with Fire and connection to Air(via Vata humor).
