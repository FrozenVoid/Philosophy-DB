Why is anti-clockwise movement
is Yin and clockwise Yang?
The answer as elemental conversion.
Clockwise movement is
 South-West-North-East-South which
 is Water->Earth->Air->Fire->Water,
 that moves Earth up(refinement to Air)
 
 Water is opposed to Air,
 By conversion to Earth gets
 compatible and is refined
 to Air, then converted to Fire
 and back to Water(Fire|Water are Pitta)
 
 
 While anti-clockwise movement
 is South-East-North-West-South
 which is
 Water->Fire->Air->Earth->Water
 that moves Air energy to Earth.
 which ground Air(highly refined).
 (Water is converted to Fire(Pitte)
 Which feeds Air,then Air is
  downcasted to Earth/Water(Kapha chain
  vs Water/Fire chain in clockwise)
  i.e. anti-clockwise vortex
  end up losing energy in
   Kapha Air->[Earth-Water], while clockwise vortex
   Air->[Fire->Water]  use Pitta(Fire->Water)
   as endpoint for Air, gaining energy.
