Alchemy deals with properties
of elemental matter, 
transformations and
 combinations/configurations
 of various matter-forms.
Spiritual aspects of Alchemy
 are based on elemental magic
 relations and their 
 energetic effects on 
 the subtle bodies.
Alchemy can be considered
the 'science of elementalism',
that tries to follow and research
 elemental magic in a structured,
systematic way similar to early
physics research.
