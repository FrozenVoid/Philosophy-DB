Divination is a form of channeling
spirits which influence the
 host to pick some random destiny,
 which gives the spirit power over
 the host intents.
It doesn't matter if the method
of divination is wrong/incorrect/flawed,
the spirits can decipher intent:
powerful spirits can even
affects nearby environment,
like ouija boards which can be
 possessed - since ouija
 is also a form of divination.
Games of chance, including
 computer games/sites are also 
 valid channels for intent:
most people don't realize
 channeling process occurs
 even in picking lottery numbers
 and casino games.
 

The process is as follows:
1.An intent to know some information
is intercepted by a spirit.
2.The spirit manipulates the
 host's brain to gain influence:
 inspiration, ideas, desires.
Spirits have much more knowledge
of the future and background events.

3. Divination is processed:
A random event is now a biased
 random event, which is interpreted.
Spirits can influence brains,computer memory,
clocks and RNGs at both ends(selection and generation),
since material exists in etheric.

However for simplicity,
the common process is just
spirit finding a point in time
at which to interrupt selection 
(e.g. person doing something random)
in his favor(as known 'future' result)
from multiple alternative timelines.

4.The interpretation is influenced
by a spirit to his favor,
gaining trust and interest of host.
Vague ideas are clarified into most useful
direction of influence.

Spirit+Host channel in divination
depends on form of influence:
Usually the less 'random' event
 is the more influence is possible,
 but with practice spirits manage
 to use any channel.
examples:
1.Weakest: Quantum and Hardware RNG.
2.Weak: Software RNG, clocks.
3.Medium: Coin tosses, dice, thrown items etc
4.Strong: Cards, paper pieces, shuffling items.
5.Very Strong: Automated writing,ouija boards, Scrying.
6.Direct: Summoning, Prayer(esp. mantra-type prayers), Appeal.
