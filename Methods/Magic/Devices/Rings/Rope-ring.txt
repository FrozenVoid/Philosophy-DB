A rope ring is a makeshift ring from rope or wire/cable
that is used in temporary manner or for testing,
usually without energy charging or any enchantent:
the idea of such temporary
 rings is usually to set a virtual mudra on specific finger joint.
Similar "rope ring" effects are used for
temporary neck amulets and bracelets, 
(usually to test crystals and materials bound to rope).
