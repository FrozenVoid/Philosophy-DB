A magic ring is an object that alters
energy flow in the finger its worn on.
Any ring has magic potential, though most are unused in its
capacity or even have harmful effects as element balance is altered.
Each finger/toe is an elemental channel feeding the ring.
A ringed hand in a mudra has substantially different
effect from a naked hand(which is assummed as basis):
its unsafe to assume mudra effects will be similar.
Multiple ring on same hand can interfere with energy flow,
e.g. placing ring+thumb or pinky+index rings will 
block earth-fire and water-air axis from proper function,
though might be useful for some esoteric effects.
