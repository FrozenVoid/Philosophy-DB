A magic ring is an object that alters
energy flow in the finger its worn on.
Any ring has magic potential, though most are unused in its
capacity or even have harmful effects as element balance is altered("Ring wearing its wearer").
Each finger/toe is an elemental channel feeding the ring.
A ringed hand in a mudra has substantially different
effect from a naked hand(which is assummed as basis):
its unsafe to assume mudra effects will be similar.
Multiple ring on same hand can interfere with energy flow,
e.g. placing ring+thumb or pinky+index rings will 
block earth-fire and water-air axis from proper function,
though might be useful for some esoteric effects.

Properties:
1.Sigils and words: rings can be inscribed with sigils/words/symbols.

2.Charges: ring can be charged with energy, ritual or spell.
Specific times of day(vata/pitta/kapha time periods) will
affect energy flow and quality of charges.

3.Entity: Some entities can be bound into rings(dependent
on material/size of ring),
 its possible to tulpaforce an entity inside a ring.
Use of the ring itself grants it a subtle body
shared/bound with the soul as it touches the energy fields and subtle bodies of the entity wearing it for prolonged
periods - further it would allow any entity(bound or created)
from the ring to bind with the soul of wearer, effectivelly
possessing the subtle body connected with the ring.
 
4.location: finger(water=pinky,earth=ring,ether=middle,air-index,fire-thumb),
side of body(left-yin/right-yang),orientation of ring hand
towards the cardinal direction from body(towards w/s/n/e),
placement in finger: at base,below first joint,at first joint,
below second joint, at second joint, above second joint(near finger top).

5.Material: inner energy of a ring depends on the material,
which can act as a filter(usually inorganic) or
multiplier(usually organic material) - a "live ring material" will
be charged with warm energy, while "dead ring material" will be cold(energetically draining, e.g. metal).


What is rings power?
A ring is basically a mudra, usually an element blocking
mudra that charges its counter-part element(s):
A ring doesn't simply "drain finger channel elements" though, it alters
the flow of element either moving it into the ring(focusing
on whatever is inside it for magical purpose)
or creates a specific elemental
field that follows from the ring's edge outside and surrounds its wearer: some methods might also allow a ring
to transfer its power(accumulated energy from a finger's flow) towards a third-party entity/spell/ritual due its design.  

Rings of protections?
Rings can prevent intrusion from other entities in some cases,
but metallic armor might be far more effective at this case.
A more effective protection might occur from effects of ring's channeled energy: either making the wearer immune or
unapproachable by entities(elemental repulsion).

What can be a ring?
Anything bound around the finger can serve as a ring,
though a design that allow it contact with the skin:
gloves with gems or material inclusions can also serve as rings.

Are all rings magical?
Ring can be "anti-magic", by draining Air(index) or Ether(middle finger),
which will repel Etheric(etheric) or Astral(air) lifeforms,
though prolonged use harms etheric/astral body.

What is point of Arm rings and bracelets?
Mostly used for protection, as manipulation can't be done due combining of all elemental
channells. Arm rings will also seal any entity inside the body (including the soul) which has arms(in subtle energy form). Metallic Belts and whole-body rings can be used for similar
purposes.
