A magic ring is an object that alters
energy flow in the finger its worn on.
Any ring has magic potential, though most are unused in its
capacity or even have harmful effects as element balance is altered("Ring wearing its wearer").
Each finger/toe is an elemental channel feeding the ring.
A ringed hand in a mudra has substantially different
effect from a naked hand(which is assummed as basis):
its unsafe to assume mudra effects will be similar.
Multiple ring on same hand can interfere with energy flow,
e.g. placing ring+thumb or pinky+index rings will 
block earth-fire and water-air axis from proper function,
though might be useful for some esoteric effects.

Properties:
1.Sigils and words: rings can be inscribed with sigils/words/symbols.

2.Charges: ring can be charged with energy, ritual or spell.
Specific times of day(vata/pitta/kapha time periods) will
affect energy flow and quality of charges.

3.Entity: Some entities can be bound into rings,
 its possible to tulpaforce an entity inside a ring.
Use of the ring itself grants it a subtle body
shared/bound with the soul as it touches the energy fields and subtle bodies of the entity wearing it for prolonged
periods - further it would allow any entity(bound or created)
from the ring to bind with the soul of wearer, effectivelly
possessing the subtle body connected with the ring.
 
4.location: finger(water=pinky,earth=ring,ether=middle,air-index,fire-thumb),
side of body(left-yin/right-yang),orientation of ring hand
towards the cardinal direction from body(towards w/s/n/e),
placement in finger: at base,below first joint,at first joint,
below second joint, at second joint, above second joint(near finger top).

5.Material: inner energy of a ring depends on the material,
which can act as a filter(usually inorganic) or
multiplier(usually organic material) - a "live ring material" will
be charged with warm energy, while "dead ring material" will be cold(energetically draining, e.g. metal).
