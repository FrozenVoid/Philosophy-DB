Crystals can be used to amplify/absorb/reflect energy 
of environment & human aura to answer various needs.
Crystal structure & color determine frequencies it will
 reflect/absorb and their direction of scattering.
 
Qualities: 

Color: color of crystal is aligned with chakra color - though
 a crystal presence will affect most chakras(inter-elemental relations),
 the chakra with closest color will expirience most effect.
 
 Size: larger crystals will create larger energy flows.
 
 Structure: complex structure creates more balanced(but weaker) energy flows,
 simple structures act as mirrors/prisms with strong energy channels.
 
 Electrical conduction: crystals with higher conductivity are
  able to handle more energy piezo electric crystals transmute 
  vibrations easily to EM fields.
  
  Optical transparency: crystals will absorb less energy with more
  transparent structure, allowing them to handle much more energy
  as e.g. prism element.
  
  Hardness: crystals with higher mohs scale values will 
  be able to handle rougher/stronger energy and transmute it
  (weaker crystals will break/crumble with exposure:
  resistance to vibration/sound/radiation will compromise their structure
   sooner)
