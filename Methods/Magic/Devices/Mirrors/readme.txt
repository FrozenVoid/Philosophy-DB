Mirror effects exist on multiple planes and the construction
of material can be configured to create diverse energy flows.
Note:Any reflective surface is technically a mirror.

Purpose:
1.Defense: Mirrors can trap or absorb many 
non-physical entities or thoughtforms, especially curved mirrors.
"Halls of mirrors" ,"funny/funhouse mirrors" are extremely potent
defensive structures that humans don't appreciate.
Mirrors essentially have vast capacity
for holding etheric/astral energy.

2.Clearing/Filtering energy: Mirrors reflect energy flows they're in dissonance
with and absorb everything else like in #1,
creating a new energy flow in the area.
Silver mirror is preferred material.

2a:
Mirrored surfaces and reflection serve as detection devices,
though entities that are non-etheric will not appear(mental 
illusions,  mental entities,projected mental thoughtforms)

2b.Energy filter: Mirrors of specific curvature or construction
can be used as energy filter or concentrators, usually as
protective element in area(like #1).

3.Portals: Mirrors can be used to form energy portals/links to
various realms/entities(mental projection)
3a.Summoning: Mirrors can be used for summoning rituals,
as device establishing connection with an entity.
3b.Scrying devices are usually mirror-like, allowing
to mentally project to specific location/realm.
