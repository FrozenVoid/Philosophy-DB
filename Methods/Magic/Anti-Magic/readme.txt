Anti-magic is an umbrella term for methods that counter
 magic(magical effects and energy(usually of elemental origin)).
 Note that subtle bodies will also be affected by anti-magic as
 their operation is essentially 'magical'(subtle energies).
 
 Anti-magic type 
 1.Counter-magic - "Dispell": magic to dispell/drain/reverse existing magic spell/state/curse/etc.
 example:An active, temporary spell/ritual that cleanses pre-existing magic in the area.
 
 2.Enchantment against magic - "Genius loci": item or place that has been protected from magical/etheric/astral intrusion.
 The nature of item/place isn't a device like #5 which is mechanical,
 but like a thoughtform that actively protects an object/place(
 e.g. guardian tulpa/servitor).
 
 3.Elemental drain - "Forced Grounding": a specific device or item that drains elemental energy:
usually limited to single element, works like a element-drain mudra applied to area.
Alchemical devices of this nature can also capture area's energy to create 
specific effects. 

4.Anti-magic suppresion field - "EM veil":
magnetic/EMF fields of specific frequency will repel magical energies.
Unintentional "white noise" EMF fields also work at weaker level.
Acoustic wide-spectrum(pink/white/brown/etc) noise can disrupt magical effects that are etheric
(ether is generally most vulnerable to material effects).

4b. Nuclear radiation, X-rays etc can destroy/damage magic of etheric nature:
The effect is proportional to energy of extreme EM photons and charged particles.
e.g. eating brazil nuts(naturally radioactive) is anti-magic but
taking an X-ray scan is more damaging(etheric body is 'magically vulnerable').
 
 5.Magic repelling Amulets/Charms/Armor/Jewelry - "Energy Filter":
 items with materials or spells that protect from magic(the latter
 could have a temporary effect like a 'video game buff' charging
 a material with specific energy).
 The principle is either redirection or conversion of incoming
  energy, often 'recharging' the item in process of countering damage.
  
5b.Magic-absorbing substance - "Magic Armor": various organic substances can
 absorb etheric/astral energy by bulk mass or charge.
 A more subtle magical energy(mental/astral) will be able bypass uncharged organics:
 i.e. to stop astral energy you need charged astral-level field,
 to stop mental energy you need charged mental-level field.
 
 6.Plane displacement - "Sealed place": a physical area that has been
 sealed by (non-material) domain walls on etheric/astral 
 level to prevent intrusion or magical spells,
 usually combined with other forms of anti-magic disruption.
 
 6b. Planar isolation - "Hall of mirrors":
 an inverse portal set placed over the 
 area entrances/walls/exits that redirects energy flows/entities
 towards different areas, like a series of magic wormholes built
 around a physical core shielding it.
