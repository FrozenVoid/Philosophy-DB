 Direction according to magnetic North:

Sleeping on stomach alters the flow of Ether,
dependent on many factors and is not advised:
the position is vulnerable to astral/mental attack,

Sleeping on back is a neutral flow activating
the direction element, but its overflow
will cause nightmares(colored according to direction)
