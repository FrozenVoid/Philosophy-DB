A wall is a grounding connector to Earth(via building structure),
which will add substantial Earth element to sleep asana,
dependent to direction where wall is faced:
1.If sleep asana lacks grounding, it will lead to vata overload.
i.e. room center bed, oriented to Air/Fire element.
2.If sleep asana is heavy Earth/Water wall will magnify side effects
of these elements, (cold & infflamation)
3.Feet-facing wall is preffered for head-facing wall, as grounding
works better with feet.
