Clockwise and anti-clockwise walking create
a directional vortex where body chakras rotate around central axis.
Clockwise(deosil) walking creates Yang energy(as rotation around right hand) 
and AntiClockwise(Widdershins) creates Yin energy vortex(as rotation around left hand).
Rituals often involve 'charging a circle' where multiple people walk in one direction,
creating a big directinal vortex in the ether.
