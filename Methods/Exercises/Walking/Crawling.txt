Note: if you aren't comfortable
 with void(palm chakra) activity
and prolonged grounding avoid this.
Method:
1.Pick a cardinal direction,
e.g.(South-west) which energy
you associate/want.
2.Note: implied that surface
is safe/soft enough for crawling
on knees.
Stand on knees facing the direction
of crawl exactly aligned.
Note:
Color of lower clothes must not be Red
or any dark color(gray/brown/black),
as grounding will drain elemental
 energies with direct contact:
 i.e. grounding will intensify otherwise.
3. Place hand palms on the ground
you don't have to put weight on
them, only spread the fingers abit
so void chakras start echanging
energy with earth.
4. Wait until you feel the hands
elemental channels have been
 balanced with current earth position
4.Advancing in the cardinal direction
chosen before. Repeat 3.
You will look like a person
 slowly crawling forward
 with large rest
 periods(it is preferred to do this
 unnoticed by public) leaving
 handprints in a series of steps.
 
 5.Stop when you feel satisfied
with the result or feel drowsy.
This practice will be useful
for Earth elemental magic and
grounding upper chakras(esp. Heart).
