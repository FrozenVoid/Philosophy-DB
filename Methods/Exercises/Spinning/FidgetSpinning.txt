Fidget spinning is powerful exercise for altering
yin(counter-clockwise) and yang(clockwise) forces.

Spinning object has to be a certain color,
the color will define the chakra/plane being active
during exercise: use white or yellow as default if you don't
know which chakra flow will be most beneficial.


Use of hands: left hand spinning will resonate
with yin objects internals(and will absorb the energy),
while right hand use will spread energy around area and
will interact with emanated fields of object.



What signs are that there is abudance of Yin?
The sense of heaviness and sleepiness, overwhelming

sensation of quietness/calmness, cold energy.
Yin is however not a stable state and will like Yang
over-abudance come in conflict with energetic demands
of the body out of balance with environment.





What signs are that there is abudance of Yang?

Agitation, nervousness, hot energy flows, world

around becoming more active, loudness and perception
of color increases, the world is sensed as more "alive"
and "vibrant" as if the rhythm of life has jumped to another
octave. Chakra flows, minor inflammation and over-excited
 states of mind usually follow.
