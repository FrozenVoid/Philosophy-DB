Spinning is a exercise to generate an energy vortex from your chakras:
Method: Slowly(1 spin in 10 sec) move in walking pattern around yourself:
Spinning too fast may has dangerous side effects due induced elemental flows(for same reason
avoid being present in vehicles/places that spin fast)
1. Clockwise spinning: this raises energy, increases Pitta(Fire/Water),
boosts circulation, increases vibration rate, growth & regeneration.
Note:
Clockwise spinning creates a downward vortex for, materialization
and absorbtion of energy. 
Avoid excess Fire as it causes
 systemic infllamation, when downward flow of energy meets
  any blockage or lack of space.

2.Counter-clockwise spinning: reduces energy, increases Kapha(Water/Earth),
increases material powers,decreases vibration rate, reduce influence of magic/ether.
Healing & grounding.

Note: Counter-clockwise spinning
is essential for creating counter-clockwise refinement vortexes(see Alchemy section)
in a room for various magical purposes(e.g. cleansing/grounding a room).
