The idea is with exercise, senses could ne magnified by
 increased neural sensitivit for practical utility:
 Ideas:
 1/Hearing: earplugs to reduce sound volume to enhance sound
  reception when without earplugs. brain adapts to compensate sound levels.
 2.Eeysught-far focus: keep a monitor or some focus object just
   at the out of focus are where letters(set a small font) seem blurrry:
   with time the eye will refoxus on the further an further distance.
  3.Taste: use a much smaller amount of spice/salt and try to distinguish
 foods with minor difference in preparation.
 4.location awareness:with closed eyes try to move (slowly)
 (in a safe area) to develop muscle memory of pathing.
