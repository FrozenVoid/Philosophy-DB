Grounding is a method for
 balancing one's energy system
 with the environment.
It have numerous benefits and
 costs, in elemental sense:
 the grounding will engage:
 1.Earth grounding:
 Connecting hands or bare feet
 to the hard surface connected
 to ground(Walls/Floors/Earth/
 Sand) of the local environment.
 i.e. the Local Ground.

2.Water Grounding("Fluid ground"):
Automatic by staying in water
 with hands/feet below surface
 for few minutes.
A portable reservoir for
grounding one hand is sufficient.

3. Fire balancing("Fire ground"):
Placing hand above source
of heat and spreading fingers
(esp. left hand) will charge
 or "ground" with local Fire channels:
 this is useful for some areas
 of permanent heat sources that
 alter local energy flow.
