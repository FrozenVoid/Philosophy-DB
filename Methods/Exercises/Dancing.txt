Dancing(i.e. moving rhythmically)
is a powerful exercise that sets
the body vibration similar to asanas.

Dancing includes:
1. Rotations: clockwise and anti-clockwise
 danding is similar to circle-walk
 and spinning.
2.Brainwave synchronization:
Dance rhythm initiates low-level
 syncing in active state of brain.

3.Opening of void chakras:
By spreading hands/feet the 
 void vortexes in armpit, knees
 and root chakra are rhythmically
 opened/spread, with energy flowing in/nearby.

4.Side walking:
Dancing features lots of side-walking(
e.g. walking by moving to side,
with legs skipping to left/right)
which induce powerful energy flows,
similar to moving in cardinal direction
of e.g. East,

5.Circle charging:
Dancing around a central object
charges the field with energy
vortexes generated from spinning
 chakras in paths around it.

6.Dancing is useful for
maitaining flows of fluids in
joints and bones, countering
 vata corruption and bone stiffness
 resulting from vata-overload.

7.Dancing disrupts tracking
of etheric body, probably the reason
 elves dance so much:
 the astral parasites cannot
 see energy signatures if 
 position is constantly disrupted.

8.Dancing interferes with mental
 beacons, by changing focus to
 material pathing/movement:
A mental plane anchor requires
energetic stability of the host,
which rotations/side-walks/jumps
disrupt.
