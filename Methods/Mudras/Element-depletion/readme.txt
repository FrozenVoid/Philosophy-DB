Element depletion can be accomplished by
1.linking the element channel to void(shunyata) center at center of palm
Usually, using the opposite hand palm center is more effective(due preventing own hand element links).

2.boosting the opposite element with Fire(increase elemental ratio).
(this reduces the element influence, not size).
Fire->Earth
Earth->Fire(using Ether to increase fire-space)
Ether->Void(palm center)
Water-Air
Air->Water
Void->Ether

Thumb of hand can also be pressed
down by other fingers,
to deplete that element energy
which is usually fed by fire.


3.Grounding the element with Earth finger or connecting it to the ground(Earth).

4.void vortexes:
Void element activates
when flexible elements(hands/fingers/feet/jaws)
spread apart. This depletes
 Ether and reduces elemental space for everything else.
