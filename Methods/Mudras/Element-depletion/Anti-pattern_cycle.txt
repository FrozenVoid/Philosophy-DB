A prolonged elemental depletion will
start a cycle of opposing element that will counteract 
the depletion by the opposition/reaction of the body to unnatural
energy balance.

Lack of Air:
Air cycle, Air increases leads to decrease in Water(Opposed by air)
which boosts its sibling Earth(Kapha humor),
 which reduces Fire, reducing Water(Pitta humor),
which is further boosting Air(water opposition dries out),
Leading to dehydration and aging(lack of water).

Lack of Water:
Water cycle, water increase boosts Fire(Pitta humor),
reducing Earth(opposing Fire) and Air(opposing water),
Ether is reduced by vata humor depletion(Air-ether) despite 
plentiful fire energy, leading to infllamation(few space, lots of fire),
insomnia and hormonal unbalance.

Lack of Earth:
Earth cycle,Earth increase depletes Fire,dominating Water,
which boosts Air, leading to Air cycle.

Lack of Fire:
Fire cycle,Fire increase lead to Earth depletion, then
its sibling Water(by Kapha) is dominated by Fire,Increasing
Air(opposed by Water) leading to Air cycle,

Lack of Ether:
Ether increase, Ether increase boosts Air(sibling Vata),reducing
Water and leading to Air cycle.

Lack of Void(shunyata):
Ether overabudance will causes cycles of the element
which is most energized by it,usually Fire: lead to Air cycle.
