Movement captures the element in the path of person
usually Air and Ether in its own aura, boosting them.
Travelling by a vehicle significantly increases these elements
due speed of movement, however the vehicle absorbs most of such
energy for itself.
Mudras done during the activity are boosted by it:
e.g. mudras under a waterfall benefit from background Water element.

Movement near or through water boosts Water(e.g. beach activity,swimming).
Movement nearby or through fire(e.g. jumping over fire/lava/embers) boost Fire.
Movement through earth(e.g. digging,moving underground) boosts Earth.
Specific:
Mountain climbing increases Ether and Earth.
Air travel boosts Air. Sea travel increases Water.
