Excretory activity activates Ether channels
and water/Earth element dependent on excreted material.
Apana Vayu governs excretion.
All mudras done during excretion will interfere with Apana vayu:
either they'll boost or supress Apana flow as it activates,
especially unbalancing are Fire/Water element boosters(infflamation, diarrhea)
