Apana Vayu governs excretion(Earth and Ether elements).
Excretory activity activates Ether channels
and water/Earth element dependent on excreted material(thereby reducing these element),
farting also reduces Air element(accumulation of which dries the intestines and boosts Vata).

All mudras done during excretion will interfere with Apana vayu:
either they'll boost or supress Apana flow as it activates,
especially unbalancing are Fire/Water element boosters(infflamation, diarrhea).
