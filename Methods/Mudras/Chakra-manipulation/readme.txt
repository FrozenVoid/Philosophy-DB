Chakra manipulation mudras are used to
correct lack of balance or encourage energy flow in chakras,
usually concentrating on the outward channel of chakras
or elemental flows along the spine which are connected to them:
e.f. pressing a finger on the chest area.

This practice carries many risks vs normal mudras,
as chakras and elements are directly engaged with 
highly negative consequences if chakra is overloaded or
its channells are forcefully shifted due mudra nearby:
the energy configuration of entire etheric body is 
deeply affected in case of any mistake: sending energy towards
a chakra direction is much safer..
