Also known as Heaven mudra, Void mudra,etc.

Method: thumb pressed on last joint of middle finger.
Usage: Only as needed, major side effects.

Effect: pain reduction, reduces sensations overall,
used with air reduction(thumb on index joint) for emotional pain.
Index and middle finger carry the vata humor(mental/emotional)
which is reduced by application of such mudras,
forcing reconfiguration towards kapha(material body) and pitta(Fire).

Meditation: used for calming meditation, induction/relaxation.
The 'Heaven mudra' name is likely due it aiding assistance
in induction of mental/astral projection.


Side effects: similar to morphine analgesics
(shunya likely activates some opioid receptors and
will cause addiction/tolerance/hypersensitivity adaptation),
throat chakra reduction(will/voice/space) 
 and ether depletion(with vata humor following).
