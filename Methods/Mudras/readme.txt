mudras are configurations of elemental channels in
hands fingers(or rarely feet/toes).
Elements(and their opposite channel, same applies to toes):
Ether - middle finger| Space(growth - shrinkage) | void(anti-ether) - palm center
Fire - thumb | Energy type(hot-cold) |Earth - Ring
 Air - Index | Sensitivity(emotion/reaction vs sense/action)  | Water - Pinky 



vs Asana: Asanas are more subtle, long-term reconfiguration
of core channells in the spine and major bones.
Asanas are mostly safer but require more gymnastic skill and
can be combined with mudras for greater effect.

vs Mantras: mudras are more direct and continuos operation
 method to change energy flow, while it instantly alters the floaw
 of elemental energies it also lacks any safety
 mechanisms(which mantras engage on mental level)
 allowing one to damage subtle bodies from incorrect mudra use.

Extended overview:
The main advantage of mudra is direct access to
all elemental channels without any mental preparation:
mudras rapidly(in minutes vs hours of mantra chanting)
reconfigure the energy-flow pattern in all subtle bodies:
Mantras require the higher-level chakras properly energized
and locked into a mantra pattern - with constant energy focus
on chanting: mudras allow mental space to focused elsewhere,
even while sleeping(mudras are incredibly powerful during
sleep(as it is a state of projection) though much less safe to operate:
as the mudras of sleeping bodies connect to elemental source
of the plane in which the body's mind 'dreams').

Disadvantages of mudras: 
A mudra is a brute-force reconfiguration that requires
specific chakras on healthy energy level;
if a mudra is attempting to use specific channel 
of that chakra that is weak or damaged, the body will
be further damaged and depleted. A mudra
 rarely repairs or balances the channels(all finger mudras
 are an exception) leading to unbalanced state
 where some elements dominate: this state is dangerous
 long-term and will cause disease(elemental depletion).
Mudras can be thought of a short-term tactical magic,
with mantras as long-term strategy: it is entirely possible
to replace most mudras with mantras, but unless the hands
are kept at neutral position all times the person
will unconsciously connect fingers/hands/toes in problematic
ways that will add unbalanced flows that will not be corrected
by mantras.
Mudras power(mudras are stronger due direct elemental connection)
 is also its weakness as depletion of element will come
 without warning(as most people lack the subtle sense of their
 energy balance and cannot sense level of specific element)
 so proper mudras use is a much higher-level technique 
 than is expected
 from its low-level brute-force physical nature.
