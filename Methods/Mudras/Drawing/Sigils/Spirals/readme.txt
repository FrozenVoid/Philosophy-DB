Spirals are drawn defined as following

Outward-distributive spirals(Center to Edges): 
 A.Clockwise outward spirals: Yang,
 solar fire,Increase in all elements
 except Earth, distributive.
 right hand usually used.
 This is usually the spiral 
  for 'charging energy in room'.
 
 
 B.Anti-Clockwise outward spirals:
 Yin, Grounding,"Slowing",
 distributive Yin: energy of 
 slowing and calming, used
 with left hand usually.
 Usually used to 'ground space'.
 
Inward-gathering spirals(Edge circles to Center)
 A.Clockwise inward spirals: Yang,
 solar fire, gathers energy
 in the hand/object/center of 
 spiral. This is most common
 spiral for energy gathering.
 
 B.Anti-Clockwise inward spirals:
 Yin, Grounding, gathering 
 passive/slowing kapha energy
 in environment for healing
 and self-balancing/centering/
 grounding elements(except Earth).
 
Mirroring spirals(balanced flows):
General:
One hand/finger(s) draws 
a clockwise spiral the other
draws anti-clockwise spiral.
Begin by moving the hands 
(aligned with selected 
cardinal direction) in circles
against each other, and either
1.Increase circle size(for
outward spiral)
2.Decrease circle size(from
initial huge circle to hands
closely circling each other).
