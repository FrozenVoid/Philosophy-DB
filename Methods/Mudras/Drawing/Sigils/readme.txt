Air sigils are figures drawn
with finger(s) in imagined
'invisible ink' in the air:
visualize the path as 'general drawing
 directions', not as precise
 locations but a guiding direction.

Figures of air sigils are
 repeated until
the desired elemental configuration]
is reached,like a mudra or mantra.

Feet can be used for air sigils
from a comfortable position
to manipulate lower elemental
channels.
