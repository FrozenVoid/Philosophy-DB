Circle drawing is one
of most common air sigils,
often performed unaware(
as finger circling or hands
circling around each other)
Circles activate specific
 elemental flows dependent on
  their location and direction.
  
 1.Clockwise/Anti-clockwise(
 from body pov):
 Yin/Yang,Kapha/Pitta,Lunar/Solar.

2.Cardinal direction:
(East=Fire,West=Earth,North=Air,
South=Water)
the edges of circle move energy
from one element to another in
two phases(clockwise mixing example):
Imagegine circle half split by
cardinal direction of circle location.
e.g. circle parallel to East-West
will be split in East side-West side.
A.Element A side: clockwise
this gathers energy from below(Yin->Yang)
 to Element A to and distributes
 to Element B from top to bottom.
B.Element B side: clockwise this
draws Element B energy from top
(Yang->Yin) and distributes it 
to element A from below.

3.Hands/feet used:
Yin hand-> Yin heavy circle.
Feet utilize lower channels 
below root(Abyssal planes) that
connect underworld energies.

4.Color of gloves and clothes
4a."Gloves"(hand wearables:
ideally in form of glove):
Act as filter for elemental energies
4b.Clothes: colors define chakra
 activations and supression, which
 influences hand energy capability.
 
5.Configuration of room/area
objects: material and colors matter
for directing elements and 
chakra balance.
