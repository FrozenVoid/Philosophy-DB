Drawing is a gesture where a figure e.g. a clockwise circle
is 'drawn' by a finger(s) which is in a mudra.
The edge of finger(s) which is energy center, can be applied to create
air sigils, figures, motions for energy manipulation/binding.
A popular example is samana mudra(all fingers together) drawing around
a sick area of the body for healing.
