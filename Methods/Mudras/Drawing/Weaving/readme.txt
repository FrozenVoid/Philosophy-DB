Weaving in the air, is an 
intuitive method
to discern and direct energy
flows in local environment.
It requires considerable practice
and patience.

Method:
1.relax, hold a meditative
 pose with maximum comfort,
 hold hands in front of body
 with all fingers relaxed.
 (similar to invisible ball
 in Balance ball, but not grasping
 the item. Do not spread fingers.)

2.Feel energy flowing in your
fingers: the energy channels
of opposite fingers from other
hand will balance out(as in Balance
 ball). This subtle flow is
 going to be the basis of 
 'energy sensing' where the
 location of energy in fingers
 will indicate its element and 
 form(e.g. outward flow in right Middle 
 finger = Yang(right) ether(middle
 finger -> Yang ether emission).
 
 
3.Hold fingers in relaxed position;
start to note minor changes in energy
as environment changes.
This is the passive stage:
try to align with the environmental
 flows without moving.
Energy flows will become notiaceable
with time and Air element will 
increase sensitivity.
Try to use intuition to modify
 positions(etheric body seeks
 optimal configuration)

4. Start slowly moving fingers
up or down and note the changes
in 'environment flows' as energy
 passes through your hands:
You will realize the open-circuit
 nature of local environment and
how elemental channels interact
 as your fingers are part of it.
 
5.Note the changes when you 
move your hands towards different
cardinal directions:
Notice how elemental flows obey
global lines of cardinal directions.
5a.Try to modify local flow
 by moving one of hands to
 a cardinal direction.
5b.Note the difference between
 right(Yang emmitter) and
 left(Yin absorber) hand as they
 influence the energy flows.
5c.Align position with 
a preferred cardinal direction:
use a compass to check if you like.
Repeat the exercise from
 different directions to see 
 how your body responds to elemental
 flows of cardinal directions.
You will now have an intuitive
understanding what elements you
align with and how much energy
you can handle of the element.

 
6.Note how energy change when
you close circuits by touching
 fingertips with each other.
6a.Touch an object of specific
 color: notice the energy of
 corresponding chakra changes.
6b.touch the center of other
hand's palm and note the 
decrease in elemental flow.
(This is the 'void' element
center)
6c.Spread fingers and notice
how energy dissipates in
palm center vortexes.
6d.End exercise.
