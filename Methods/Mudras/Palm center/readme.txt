Palm center hosts the central hand chakra,
which represents the Void(shunyata) element as opposed to fingers
elemental channells which are connected with it by gateways(normally closed or semi-open).
The chakra is activated by spreading the fingers apart as
far as possible. The 'shuni mudra' just blocks ether channel
of middle finger, but any mudra with spread fingers will
fully activate the Void channel and open the etheric gateways in
 the hand between all finger bases and palm center.
Duration: requires at least 15-20 to full activate.
The mudras based on Void element(spread-fingers type) will
cause various etheric transformations in subtle bodies:
these may be dangerous in some energy configurations,
as the hand chakra is extremely energy-intensive object(c.f.
depictions of 'black hole' hand spirals in fiction) with
requirements that need a healthy etheric body with functioning
channells and steady energy supply.

Side effects: Chills, nightmares, intrusive thoughts,
effects depends on exact position of hands/cardinal direction
and overall body position during activation.
