Left(non-dominant hand) palm
 usually absorbs energy
 and right hand projects
 it(various practices
 may change the configuration:
 it is safer to start with both
 palms).
Void element will activate 
in all case when fingers
are spread.


Position of active palm
in term of cardinal direction
influences types of energy 
interacted with:

1.Downward: Void(default),Earth(if close to ground),
Water(if near water),Fire(if downward
direction contains heated objects,
such as electric wires, fire, hot pipes).

2. Upward: Ether(default) 
and Air(dependent on location. wind
 will add Air, elevation Ether).
Any objects between the sky and
the palm will alter interaction.

3. North: Air(default),
 Ether(if even slightly upward).

4.East: Firedefault), Earth(depletion of Fire
and Fire use will activate it)

5.South: Water(default), Fire(via Pitta)

6. West: Earth(default), Air(due Earth-Air
 synergy and North proximity)
