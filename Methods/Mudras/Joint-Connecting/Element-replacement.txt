(note that this may overload some elements);
Finger X middle joint(next above base) is pressed by finger Y tip
example: middle finger middle joint is pressed by pinky tip of other hand.
(replacement by compatible element such as air/ether/fire will
increase the element itself, due inter-element balance)
Tip of the Ring(Earth) finger used will add grounding effect
for any element boosted by fire(air,ether,water,fire),which will
supress/reduce its flow.
Tip of Thumb(Fire) finger used will energize the element boosted by fire(air,ether,water,fire) being
replaced, which may create infflamation and other side effects.
Tip of the Index(Air) finger also refines the element(except water which opposes it).
Tip of the Pinky(Water) finger also increases the element flow(except Air, which it supresses).
Tip of the Middle(Ether) finger adds space for the element to expand or reduces its density(boosts air/ether/fire, reduces water/earth)
