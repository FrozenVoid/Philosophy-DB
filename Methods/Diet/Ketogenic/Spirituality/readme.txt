ketogenic diet has hidden spiritual benefits:
Its anti-epilepsy protection is actually a reorganization of the brain to a state where spirits cannot interfere in its function(epilepsy is one of these forms of interference).
Mental clarity, emotional stability and IQ boosting effect also occur if the diet is followed for extensive periods.
Meditation is greatly simplified, with much less of mental fog and background cravings(glucose cravings are primary trigger, we think of food in the background alot).
