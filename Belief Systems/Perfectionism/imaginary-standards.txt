Imaginary standards are a set 
of perfectionist beliefs that
 effectively self-sabotage efforts
by imposing very high standards
 of moral or spiritual qualities
that believer assumes are required
for some category.
The absurdity often devolves
into 'purity spirals' where perfect
behavior & moral character are 
treated as basic requirement for something.
