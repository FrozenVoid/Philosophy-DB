A futile task is any method/system which lacks perfection in
its final form, that incremental improvement on such task
doesn't reach perfection of form due inherent system constraint.
An example could be 'having the highest rating in Chess',
which at first glance signifies a 'perfect score', but in
perfectionism such a position implies some inferiority
as chess players lose games and ratings don't reflect their true
ability: improving one's chess skills does not reach
perfect chess-play due limits of human cognition - and ultimately
chess-play skill improvement is a futile task without a perfection
of form(invincible chess-play strategy) resulting from its practice.
A commited perfectionist would reject words such as 'practice makes perfect'
due limits of practice-based improvement and would instead choose
different approaches(e.g. a perfect computer chess engine) to reach 
'task perfection' that doesn't require the futile task of 'practice'.
