Many New Age beliefs on earth
 incarnations mention 'unique 
 expirience' as important factor:
 the idea is absurd as absolute
 majority of 'unique expiriences'
 are spiritually detrumental
 and only a tiny sub 0.01% of 
expirience has a chance of causing
spiritual progress, however the
rest of expirience will always
negate the tiny progress gained,
as most people get corrupted by
material reality and will just 
use the spiritual advance for
material benefit.
