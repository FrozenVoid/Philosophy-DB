In New Age beliefs reincarnation
is viewed as a choice or picked
by 'higher self'. This is obviously
 absurd as no sane entity would 
 choose conditions of such reincarnation
 with knowldege of higher plane 
 existence: 
 the belief is equivalent
 to an Earth person choosing to live
 as homeless in a poor city with
 no chance of progress while
 having billions at the bank and
  multiple houses to choose from.
 
i.e. there is no point at choosing
Earth, and 90% of Earth incarnations
for their poor quality of life 
and immense soul corruption that
ensues through reincarnation in
such conditions.
