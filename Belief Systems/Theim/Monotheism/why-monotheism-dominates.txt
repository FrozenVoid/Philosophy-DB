Monotheism has multiple underlying advantages vs polytheistic system,
where it takes a form that is more spiritually pure in energy terms.
All religions are ultimately competing egregores that
require specific conditions to operate: monotheistic
egregores have numerous advantages in gathering energy of believers.

Monotheism (largely) excludes rituals/prayers
where an object of worship is lower rank deity/spirit:
e.g. summoning/self-mutilation/sacrifice/idol worship/amulets of specific god-of-X

All these rituals have in common that they are material
actions created for a being dependent on energy of such 
'low-level' rituals with 'low-quality' energy from basic emotions:
egregores of a lower rank deity/spirit/demon/angel/etc that cannot
develop high-level mental-spiritual connection to its worshippers 
requiring such 'crude' rituals, a religious mechanism of primitive
psychology and superstitious patterns of thoughts(magical thinking)
that drive (largely pathological) religion of non-spiritual nature:
egregores with monotheistic abstractions outrank such rituals with
more focused, mental worship methods that connect easily with the
egregore('personal god').

Monotheistic religion allows to reduce difference between
worshippers, creating more common ground vs polytheistic society
that lacks religious unity(a competitive advantage easily lost
with intolerance to change/heresy) which egregore needs
to function.

A religion can turn more focused(monotheistic, focused on single egregore) at expense 
of fanatical extremism(intolerance/rigidity) and stagnation(low novelty/attraction)
or more inclusive(polytheistic, multiple egregores sharing energy) at expense
of ideological weakness(egregore creation) to heretical/novel belief.

Its easier to see how energy sharing of polytheistic pantheon
is energetically inferior to single-egregore worship: the
power of worship is spread by lack of belief centralization 
and efficiency of energy transfer is weaker due 
 material mindset of polytheist ritual methods:
 such energy is also lower quallity(less abstract/pure)
 with negative entities taking a major share
 (sacrifices/pain/suffering/death/black magic - attract entities who embody
 such qualities in their abstract form), 
 polytheistic egregores however have the advantages
 of easy formation(belief formation->egregore)
 or conversion from existing spirits taking
 the role of egregore channel.
