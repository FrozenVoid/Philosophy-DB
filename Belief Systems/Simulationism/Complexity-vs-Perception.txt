perception of a simulation
being simulated is a shortcut
to simulate complex reality:
it negates need to "simulate everything"
by concentrating on 'perceived things'
i,e, what is observed.
A similar optimization in video
games is used to render only
parts of world looked at,
with everything else given
only basic details.

Multiplayer:
Simulation that has great complexity
doesn't actually have to render
everything as-is,by reusing
pre-existing renderings(Caching)
and extrapolation(pre-rendering)
to avoid replication of computation
for every player.

Some aspects of simulationism
 draw parallels to video game
  complexity and RNGs,
where seeded worlds evolve to
incredibly complex scenarios
from a single number for a RNG:
like a simple singularity expanding into
a complex universe with galaxies.
