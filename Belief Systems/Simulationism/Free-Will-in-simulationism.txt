Simulationism excludes the
 possibility of MWI -
 forking of reality into multiple
 worlds with independent timelines:
I.e. the timeline is entirely
 deterministic and linear.
 
 Arguments for:
 1. Simplicity:
 Forking reality into multiple
 paths because some microbe
  randomly decided to swim left
  or right makes zero sense
 and requires exponential hardware
  resources to support 'free choice'.

2. Ability to debug/analyze:
Fully deteerministic world
has no true randomness and each
path has concrete causes and effects;
similar to Buddhist concept
of 'depenedent origination',
each simulated event has a chain
of causes and effects.

3. Inability to observe
 quantum state as is, with
  observation process modifying reality.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem
This would be explained in simulationism
as prevention of direct access to
underlying memory, which would
 be insecure - instead allowing
 'proxy observation' wrapping the real 
 state inside 'observation access event',
 like a database query.

4.General dislike of random factors
 like 'chaos' by programmers:
Complications from random elements
 might require more effort to prevent
 'corner cases' of configurations
 where bugs/crashes/exploits are possible:
 e.g. programmers excluding possibility
 of specific event sequence or configuration
 of objects, that with random(chaos)
 influence will eventually manifest.
 
 


Arguments against:
1.Quantum randomness:
Existence of basic, irreducible
 chaos inside the simulation
that can't be explained(hidden variables)
is a primary argument.

2.Free Will from different plane:
The argument is that
 thoughts/ideas originate in
 higher planes and bypass determinism
 by adding another layer:
This doesn't prevent determinism 
as it requires the original 
source to be random,
but adds a possibility of
 some idea acting as timeline  
 splitting event by interpretation.
