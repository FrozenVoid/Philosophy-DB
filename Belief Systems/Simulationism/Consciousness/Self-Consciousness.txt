Self-Consciousness(SC) is a fundamental quality of
existence that is assumed to require apriori existence
of mind-substrate maintaining this "stream of Consciousness":
The point of reference to expirience of 
existence in-situ: even in "brain-in-a-jar" simulation
the mind-substrate has locality and separate
existence than global/group consciousness.
Given that all living entities have SC,
simulation requires running separate processes
and hardware-level separation for a simulated
reality that is running concurrently with
replicas of each world: such collosal waste of
resources is highly unlikely, equivalent to
a MMO client running entire copy of MMO locally
with other clients sending updates to it.

The idea of SC being shared resource has 
the following advantages:
1.Time-sharing SC: micro-slices of SC could be
allocated as required.
2.Coherence: entire SC runs on single mind-substrate
3.No multi-threaded realities required.

So a pragmatic simulated world would likely use
single Self-Consciousness as component module
allocated to each "mind-process" in simulation:
when the simulation needs SC in a mind, 
the mind uses the shared module instead of
running SC as separate observational process:
The idea that SC magically multiplies resource
requirements for a simulation(multi-reality simulation)
is an unoptimized brute-force solution that
implies mind-qualia/mind-configuration are somehow
dynamic processes requiring constant reinforcement
to exist, instead of local configurations that 
global SC module loads per-mind as required
for self-observation.
