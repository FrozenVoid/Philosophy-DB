The most common counter-argument from 
a spiritual standpoint, is that existence of 
subtle bodies/souls/spirits within the physical
and ensuing multi-planar complexity of 
interactions(e.g. possession/projections/dreams)
 is prohibitively expensive to simulate as
 giant, open system of planes is tangential to
 simulating a physical world such as Earth:
Resources that are spent to simulate 
extremely complex spiritual expiriences and
subtle planes(e.g. where a person can create
entire fantasy worlds from free will,as in lucid
dreams) would be out-of-proportion to their 
intended "expirience value"(e.g. a single person
dreaming up a complex world where entities can have
their own dreams, creating a recursive chain of 
simulations(c.f.  Tulpa creating sub-Tulpas))
