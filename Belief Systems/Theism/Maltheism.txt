Maltheism is the idea of God(s) 
being either intentionally or
 unintentionally evil towards mankind.
Gnostics and Atheists see maltheism
as one of possible resolutions
of 'problem of evil',
as well as literal bible interpretations
of Old Testament and criticism of Quran:
in both cases God(monotheistic) allows/creates evil.

Maltheism is especially relevant
for judging the behavior of
polytheistic gods(Etheric/Astral
 entities) which have much lower
 moral standing than Mental plane
 (where monotheism originates).
