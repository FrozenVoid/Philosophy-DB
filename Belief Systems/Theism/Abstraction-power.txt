Abstraction power ranking is measure of religion's abstraction level
usually applying to specific period and form in isolation:
the remoteness of concept from daily expirience is key to
its ranking with mental abstraction complexity required for a believer.

Direct deification of observed entity:
1.Specific observed entity: worship of specific animals/trees/humans by their name.
2.Specific natural phenomenon worship: deification of natural forces that
are observed in person 
e.g. specific instance of lightning,fire,waterfall,wind as entities with spirit.
2b.References to natural forces as object of worship with repeated
exposure leading to abstract 'similar entity' worship:
e.g. lightning/fire as category-spirit of same entities manifesting.

Material entity 'spirit':
3.Spirits of directly observed cosmic entities: 
sun/moon/stars/planets,
their representation as images/items.
3b.Constellations and periodic entities(eclipses,comets).
4.Spirits of place/feature with unclear boundary:
sea/river/lake/mountains/caves,
e.g. god of Mountain X,god of Cave Y,
leading to category worship where God of specific X,Y gains
responsibility for all X,Y-type place/feature in region.

Category control spirits:
5.Spirits of abstract species: e.g. bear spirit, lion spirit,human as group
3b.Idols/Items representing entities/species as proxy.
6.Spirits of specific territory category: god of all seas 
7.Spirits of material concepts: god of all swords
8.Spirits of mental concepts: god of love
9.Spirits of single domain: god of domain X(god of heaven/hell/earth)
10.Spirits of multiple domains:  creator/demiurge/king in control of all domains.
11.Spirits of all domains/realms: multiversal rulers with omni-qualities, all-encompasing energy, abstract cosmic forces
