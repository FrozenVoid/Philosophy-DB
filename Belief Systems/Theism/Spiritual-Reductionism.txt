Spiritual reductionism is a religious analogue of 
materialist reductionism(all reducible to chemicals & molecules).
In this scheme the humans act as conduit for spiritual influence:
1.all human thoughts are inserted or inspired by spirits
with bodies simply serving as dumb terminals for the souls/spirits.
2. all actions are dictated by higher forces in a pre-determined set of plans
3.human mental facilities are dependent on the spirits, brain is just a receiver
4.human inventions, art and culture are made for humans by spirits.
