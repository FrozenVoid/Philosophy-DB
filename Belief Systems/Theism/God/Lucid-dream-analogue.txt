Usually the idea of 'powerful world-rulers God' is extremely
counter-intuitive in abstract terms as why would a world contains
its own ruler/creator/designer(i.e. non-externality of God:
the idea if 'world is create by X, it will not contain X as its part').

A concept of such God that can be easily understood
is lucid dreaming realms:when a person achieves 
lucidity the dream(astral place) becomes a personal domain malleable by its creator
to any change, warping 'dream reality' towards dreamer's(represented
by its dream avatar form) will:
however entities inside the dream will influence it back
and may even surprise the dreamer in their behavior as lucidity/control
is not perfect, while being 'omni-powerful' to change dream
 direction and having complete control over its avatar.
