The process of evolution
of religions indicates strongly
that mental plane
 rulers(Brahma or monotheistic 'God')
 crafted religion
 out of worship of etheric gods(
 polytheism) to displace their power
 and assume direct rule, rather
 than intermediate with lower gods.

The new intermediates were prophets
and saints: they were human but
due planar interference from nearest
 mental plane outranked all etherics
  and astral 'gods'.
 
 Its likely Buddhism was also 
 started this way, even though 
 the control comes from different
 plane, the higher plane power 
 (where buddhism derives influence)
 is also more remote than 
 mental plane making it weaker.

Mental plane overtaking
the astral(emotional) plane 
is symbolized by victory of 
reason and theological basis
 shifting from 'bhakti mode'(emotional
  worship) toward purely mental
  faith of 'belief systems'
where abstract truth(philosophy)
and ideological fundament of religion are more important
 than methods and rituals.
