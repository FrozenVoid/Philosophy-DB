Apotheosis is belief that a human can become a godlike entity(literally becoming a god).
Such beliefs are often concealed in 'enlightment'/'transcendence' programming,
that creates an illusion that a human can 'transcend' his material incarnation:
The key problem is that energetic substrate of a human cannot 
handle an energy field of a god-level entity.
Types:
1. Dematerialization: 'Rainbow body' transition attributed to monks,
buddhist tantric techniques, ascetic practices in which spirit is elevated over matter.
The transition usually ends with death, as these practices ignore material body.
2. Avatar incarnation: an esoteric practice which allows a God to use a human as an avatar.
Usually associated with transformation mantras and often end with possession states.
3. Paranirvana: a buddhist type of soul transition which frees itself 
from all incarnations. Doesn't create a god.
4. Energy buildup practices: these various techniques stretch human
 subtle bodies to accumulate energy in attempt to transition the type of subtle-matter
 to more elevated states. Energy overload usually results.
 5.Elemental transition: any of elemental overload techniques 
 which create an imbalance(usually towards vata: air or ether) in attempt 
 to spiritualize human soul at expense of physical(earth/water : health).
