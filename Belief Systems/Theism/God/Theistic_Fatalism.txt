Theistic fatalism is a category of theism that reformulates fatalistic ideology
 into theistic foundation: "God's plan", "providence" ,"predestination",etc
  each concept binding the fate with the will of the deity in 
  strict deterministic compliance like a program set in motion.
Theistic fatalism usually dismisses ideas of imperfect, non-omniscient God as
  depicted in actual scriptures of most religions, in favor of 
 overarching "para-brahman" type entity overseeing all fate & existence.
