Simulationism, or Simulation hypothesis
is the belief that
 reality is simulated and our
 consciousness is experiencing
 either one of following scenarios.
 Theistic flavors assign 
 programmers the status of Gods of simulation.

Hardware simulation:
 A. Brain-in-jar:
Biological substrate in VR sim.
Classic example of dualistic
simulations, brains in the machine.

B.Soul-in-a-jar;
Energy substrate is put into
an illusion(maya) by higher powers,
but senses are not altered beforehand.

B-2.Spiritual delusion/dream;
similar to B, some energy substrate
simulates matter to fool consciousness
that it is 'real/physical' by manipulating
the energy substrate perception sense.
This form is compatible with
some religious interpretations,
where thoughts of 
'threads of consciousness' 
as independent spirits are 
presented as whole mind.


Software simulation:
A.Virtual people, real hardware:
Consciousness is somehow programmed
 into hardware substrate to simulate
  human minds(e.g. quantum computation)
In this scenario humans are software. 

B.Emergent consciousness:
Materialist simulationism posits
a matter-physics simulation gaining
emergent property of self-consciousness
by some backchannel or software capability.

Goal of simulationism involve
 deciphering the laws/morals/goals
 of simulation designers and testing
their simulation for potential glitches/hacks/bugs.]
Magic could be rationalized 
as "hacking/exploiting the Gods simulation"
as most supernatural beliefs would
be explained as layers of the simulation
that interoperate to generate complexity
of expirience.

Simulationism is not falsifiable,
as any 'proof/disproof of simulation'
could be simulated by designers as
 another 'invisible layer'/'hidden aspect' of expirience.

Philosophical objections:
A."Self-Consciousness"
The most famous line on mind existence by Descartes 
'I think therefore I am' is 
trivially disproven by
1.Simulation of a mental voice
to utter a phrase desired by..
2.Observing agent noticing
own assigned 'voice' and 
associating itself with the 'voice'
as Self.
3.Simulation of chemical reactions
that downcast the signal of
these thoughts into a physical
brain(also simulated,i.e.
no independent hardware-substrate is required).

B."Hardware locus-of-control"
The intuitive notion that
we are independent as
in separate hardware units,
that have different mind-streams
 directing different brains,
 is not actually a given 
 that simulated person is
 given dedicated hardware
 resources: it
 could be that resources(CPU
  threads, are shared between
  'self-conscious' minds)
i.e. even independence
of mind is simulated by
software-only separation that
'simulates hardware substrate'
(emulation of hardware/virtualized
 hardware).


Spiritual objections:
1.Astral/Mental projections:
A complex simulation can't
have agents travels through
layers of it? There is no
guarantee that a simulation
isn't dedicated to a single
'plane' of matter.

2.Existing of multiple subtle bodies
and spirits:
Simulations of multiple
 spirits and subtle bodies
 can be incredibly complex 
to transpose into one character,
but there isn't a guarantee 
that its real either.
i.e. despite reality feeling
incredibly complex and multi-planar
it can be simulated by feeding
the mind-person a picture of different senses.
