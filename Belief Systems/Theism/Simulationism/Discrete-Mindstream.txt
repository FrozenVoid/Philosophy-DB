Buddhism has a neat model
of digital reality hiding
in plain sight:
1. Time pereception is not
continous but discrete chunks
or 'Frames of Mind' that 
 humans perceive as continous
  mindstream operating.
2. Each Frame is a stage 
of conscioussness(skandhas), that
has a place in robotic,
sequential operation that
 masquerades as 'consciousness'
 that is actually a repetition
 of perception algorithm 
 where 'consciousness' is 
 just registering and processing
 unsconscious stages.
