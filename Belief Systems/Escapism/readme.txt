At some point people realize
 their reality is too shitty to live comfortably,
 they decided to either:
 1. ignore reality in favor of constructed
 /imaginary worlds(e.g. escapism).
 2. improve reality in some way(e.g. pragmatism).
 3. accept reality(e.g. stoicism).
 
 
 Escapism is the first option:
 people get lost in dreams/fantasies/drug induced
  altered states/mental projections
 to avoid dealing with physical reality.

Escapism is not a coherent belief system
 though it can be categorized broadly
 as 'rejection of reality as default frame':
 the home frame of escapists is mentally
  shifted to a 'tulpa wonderland'
  of their own design, a fictional world
  that grows in mental body like a tulpa
   and influences perceptions/sensations 
   by filtering them though 'tulpa wonderland':
   many are unaware their 'perception of reality'
   is corrupted as the influence is subtle 
   and takes years to change the mind.
   
   
  Escapism is exploited relentlessly
   by mental/astral parasites,
   some of which attach to a person.
  Fictional worlds driven by escapist
   belief are created in Astral planes:
   the 'afterlife' belief set is largely
   such escapist system that is shaped
    by religion: i.e. amount of belief shapes  
     mental worlds, manifests in astral
     and entities of astral can leach to 
     etheric and even interact with material:
 Such entities will reinforces local escapists
 and will promote more hardline beliefs(
 e.g. reality shifting, temporary possession by
 totally non-demonic fictional entities,
 effects from fiction leakin to physical)
 in a self-reinforcing, egregore-driven spiral 
 of defictionalization  escapists
 are milked for their energy 
  and vision towards the manifestation of fictional
   astral kingdoms they aligned themselves with,
   like a bargain with reality:
 a process similar to religion 
 plane-shaping forms with every major
 fictional work, allowing planar entities
 to LARP as fictional entities in exchange
 for escapist energy.
 
 
 
   
 
     
   
    Alternatives:
    Escapism is actually a desire
    for spiritual evolution and transfer
     to a higher plane, without the necessary
     effort required(as such effort is often 
     impossible or blocked in reality,
     with escapist worldview lacking in 
     diversity or imagination(ironically)).
