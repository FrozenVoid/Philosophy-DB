A planetary conjuction event occurs when one planet overlaps another
from the Earth viewpoint.
The meaning of conjuction is that influence of a planet(e.g. Saturn) being 'conjucted'
is completely removed during the period of conjuction as long as aura
of closer planet dominates the view(incomplete overlapping - planetary aura
is roughly similar to its magnetic field) - a Grand Interruption, change of course.
