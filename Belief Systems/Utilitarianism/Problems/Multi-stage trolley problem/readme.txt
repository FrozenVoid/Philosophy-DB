Utilitarianism and the idea of 'lesser evil' applied to evolving system:
Especially problematic with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_utilitarianism
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
The standard problem is compounded with the addition of similar paths
(5:1) to the one person route infinitely,
so by selecting to switch the trolley will take a route 
through 1-person tracks 
to infinity while the 5 person track will only kill that 5:
However at each 1-person track split the choice is
selecting either 1(which continues to split into more switches)
or 5 person track(which end the route):
At every opportunity, the choice is 
(1)death(+track continues to next stage)
or (5) deaths(+track ends)
With each situation judged independently, the choice 'by rule'
would be choosing 1-p track, since choosing the 5track 
will kill +4 people vs +1.

Table of deaths: 
||Stage ||1-p Track|| 5 Track(end)||explained 5 track||
||1|| 1            || 5|| 5 people die, track ends||
||2 ||2            || 6||1 person from S1,5 from s2 ||
||3||3             || 7||1 S1,1 S2,5 from S3||
As we can see at any stage the choice to 
save more people(1vs4) will force the 1-track route:
but as we see, it adds +1 victim infinitely.
This is analogue to selecting 'lesser evil option'
that perpetuates itself and outranks the greater evil with time.
