https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem

The trolley problem is a series of 
thought experiments in ethics and psychology, 
involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether
to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. 
The series usually begins with a scenario in 
which a runaway tram or trolley is on course 
to collide with and kill a number of people 
(traditionally five) down the track, 
but a driver or bystander can intervene 
and divert the vehicle to kill just 
one person on a different track. 
Then other variations of the runaway vehicle,
and analogous life-and-death dilemmas
(medical, judicial etc.) are posed,
each containing the option to either do nothing,
in which case several people will be killed, 
or intervene and sacrifice one initially 
"safe" person to save the others.
