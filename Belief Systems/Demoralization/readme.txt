Demoralization is a category 
of belief-states that lead 
one to doubt one's purpose,
moral values and 
ethical convictions: usually
 resulting in loss of self-worth
 and moral degeneration as 
 demoralization takes hold.

Demoralization is inherently
tied with 'moral systems' of 
society and 'social cohesion' 
of a group - demoralization breaks
 the trust
 (inherently good nature)and moral foundation(
 e.g. belief in justice/fairness of society)
 from the individual to the group.



Tribalism:
Demoralization tends to 
reduce social relations to
their primitive states:
tribalistic leadership and blind following of
prevailing mainstream opinion:
the demoralized cannot rely on
personal judgement and inner moral sense
to guide his actions.
