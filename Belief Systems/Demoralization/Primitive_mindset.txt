Demoralization end-state is 
more sinister as mindset of
demoralizated breaks down
inter-human relatioships and
 social interactions: empathy
 and concern for others are repressed in
 favor of crowd-following and
conforming to authority.

Demoralization is essentially
 a process of de-civilizing 
an individual into a pre-moral
 state inherent to primitive
 tribes - with all the psychological
 baggage of living inside civilization
 of course remaining in mind.

Demoralization begins as the loss of
 inner morality by external influence:
In demoralization the negative
character of own persona:
evil perception, egoism 
and asocial behavior
are used as tool to turn the 
person into a path of downward
moral degeneration, as he is 
convinced there is no way back
to normality.

Inner morality(as opposed
to externally enforced morals) loss
results in lack of guidance
and discernment of moral value:
personal desires and instincts
 that culture overrides are 
set free and 'humanity'(i.e.
enculturation) decays to primitive
 tribalistic mindsets of pre-civilized
 world - crowds, ideologies and
 religions are transformed into
  'tribes' fighting for power.
 Demoralized person will treat
 culture and society as patchwork
 of tribes instead of humans like
 himself, in desire to belong to
 group and 'strong tribe' he will
  follow authority of the strong
  vs 'greater good' set by morality,
  as whatever is 'good' is now a 
  subject of authority proclaiming it.
