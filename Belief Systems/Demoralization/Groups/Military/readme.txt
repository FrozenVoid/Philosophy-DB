Militaries are inherently 
demoralized systems pretending
 that they have social cohesion
 of natural social formation:

Why members of military are demoralized?

1.Alienation from greater society.
A military mindset is treating society 
as subservient and inferior group
that depends on its will.
The forceful separation of 
social and military life leads
to supression of human qualities
and instillment of artificial 
'warrior mentality' that contradict
the organized and systemic view
of soldiers as 'pawns' used for
 military gains. i.e. the soldier
 mentality is inherently demoralized
 state that is propped up by the
 system of military life.

2.Conviction of low self-worth:
cannon fodder mentality. The
bravado and fighting power of 
units depend on psychological
projection of own inferiority
as 'system pawns' to enemy,
which often breaks down as 
unit is forced to take casualties.

The psychology of conscripts and
professionals differs considerably
as conscripts don't base their
self-worth as part of 'military
 machine' as much as professionals
 who base their entire image 
 on 'military career'. Conscripts
will break their 'social ties' to
military command when their position
as 'cannon fodder' is inevitably
exposed as true, while professional
will be indoctrinated to fight for
the system values as their self-worth
is tied to military, not society
at large.


3.Lack of personal value: collective
 will(egregore of unit) overrides 
 personal will. The fabled 
 'esprit de corps' depends on close
 moral values and personal trust,
 which military units supress in
 favor of instilling obedience to
 authority(often without shared
 cultural/moral values) and replacement
 of culture with military agitprop
 that doesn't have moral foundation
 inherent in political ideology - 
 i.e. its a bureaucratic,
 top-down mechanical
  formation of artificial nature,
  that will break down under pressure.
  
4.Mechanical obedience to hierarchy:
soldiers trained to follow leadership
 with penalty of law set for refusal.
The artificial social respect and
subservience to people purely out
of hierarchic order, sets a deep moral
unrest of 'anti-systemic' nature that
breaks military indoctrination:
i.e. the imposed artificial hierarchy
is entirely a show of bureaucratic 
power over the individual, that
a person judges as not
reflecting true abilities and qualities
for which natural respect applies.

5.Technological inferiority:
the human being worth in modern
military is gradually decreasing due
technological means surpassing
individual combat qualities:
vehicles, missles, artillery 
have a disproportionate material
 advantage that numerically superior
 group cannot prevent.

6.Lack of cohesion: militaries
 instill obedience by force, leading
 to low trust in social group.
The national-patriotic motivation
 clashes with the order of group
 defined by bureaucratic means and
 being enforced artificially,
 as people treated as 'cogs in the machine'.
 
Rebel groups often have advantage
vs demoralized 'systemic pawns' 
of military bureaucracy purely
due inherent moral foundation 
being a product of an 
organic process rather than
instilled by force.


7.Envy of purpose: the average
member is motivated by prestige
and position of superiors, which
have meaning only within the military system,
as its worth declines in moral 
crisis - the 'moral foundation' 
of 'hierarchy of force' is inherently
amoral, regardless of formal exterior
of system the imposed 'ranks and
orders' are illusory rewards dependent
on same bureaucratic process defining
the military culture.
