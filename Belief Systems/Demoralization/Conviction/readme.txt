Type of such influence:
 1. Conviction of individual evil:
the person is convinced he is 
evil or lacks enough good will
 to be classified as good.
2. Conviction of collective evil:
the person is convinced he is
belonging to evil group, organization
or ethnic group.
3. Conviction of irredemable sin:
Person is convinced his sins
, moral failures and mistakes cannot
be fixed, redeemed or corrected.
Religions often use this tool
as general appeal to insert 
various salvation doctrines from
Christianity to Buddhism.
4. Conviction of futility of purpose:
the person's job, task or status
 is questioned and examined through
 a morality sieve to convince
 the person his purpose in
 greater scheme of things is evil,
 useless and degenerate.
5. Conviction that the person
 has created more evil by simply
 existing or functioning in society.
 The moral high ground of this
 type is usually the idea that 
all intent will be selfish and therefore
 evil, thus any action is bad.
6.Convinction that the person
is inherently evil from birth:
'evil genes','cursed bloodlines',
etc are often used in dehumanizing
arguments to convince one of
inherent, inborn evil similar 
to #2 without the possibility of
redemption: i.e. genetic fatalism.
7.Conviction of deterministic 
course of life:
the person is demoralized through
fatalistic doctrine to prevent
all motivation and action, as
his actions are fated to result
in disaster or evil consequences.
