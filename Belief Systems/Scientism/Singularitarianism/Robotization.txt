Also known as cyborgization,
a subset of transhumanist beliefs
that equate humans with biological
robots that can be 'upgraded'.
Concept of 'soul' are dismissed
as emergent states of bio-robot's
brain that can be turned off.

General ideas:
1.Implantation: adherents believe
that adding computer interfaces
 directly implanted to the body
is a harmless 'upgrade' that will
expand awareness or mental capacity,
it is not viewed as outsourcing
 personal capabilities to computers
 but as 'integration' of
 gradually increasing share of implants
 directed by decreasing mass of
 biological matter, eventually
 resulting in 'augmented' brain 
 piloting a 'cyborg' with zero
 biological parts.
 
2.Genetic modification:
the notion that complex, diverse
biological systems can be programmed
like linear programs with no
detriment to human existence,
treating DNA as source code to life.
The DNA itself isn't subject to
preservation, with 'bio-compatible' 
systems allowing full robotization 
at molecular level, using hybrid
 biomolecular and nanotech approches.

3.Efficiency in a job:
Robotization will allow advantages
 for its adherents to dominate
 all aspects of human labor.
The bio-humans will be always at
 disadvantage, pushing many to 
 adopt robot parts and implants.
 
4.Networking:
Networking implants will allow
cyborgs/robots/drones to coordinate
their efforts at unprecented level
and communicate at speed unknown 
to biological life.
