 Singularitarianism is a belief
 system, originating in transhumanist
  thought that progress in AI
  development will create an AI god,
  accelerating progress and technology
  to levels of sci-fi literature.
  
  Singularitarianism tries to 
  design frameworks in which such
  an AI god will not become too
  egoistic and lets humans to exist
   comfortably, which in turn constrast
   with 'cold rationalism' that
   scientism promotes as mental
   frameworks dealing with human issues.
