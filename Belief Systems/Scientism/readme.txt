Scientism is a category of materialist
beliefs that outwardly appear to 
focus on rational
investigation of material world(
empirical methods) that are 
actually thinly-disguised 
 beliefs in 'mainstream science narrative'
as defined by mass media and literature:
the current 'scientific consensus'
and dominant theories are the real
object of ideological adherence,
to which deviation is labeled
'unscientific', 'irrational'(as 
rational in eyes of scienstism adherents
 must follow systematic rules defined
 by mainstream science),
'pseudoscience' and 'fringe',
similar to earlier delineation
between heretical and dogmatic.

Typical positions:
1.Only the material world is real:
"that which cannot be measured
and recorded does not exist".

2.Something is valid only if 
proven by a scientific method:
the current scientific method
is based on falsifiability 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability

3.Personal expirience is 
anecdotal, unreliable and cannot
be trusted until replicated with
a large cohort study.

4.Confidence in theory implies
 its validity and dogmatic weight.
 
5.General belief in sci-fi as
guiding scientific development,
 idolization of famous scientistsand prominent media personalities
 which popularize science.

6.Opposition to spiritual/religious
 belief from hardline materialism.
Atheism, non-theism( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheism ) and simulation
 theory beliefs(Simulationism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)
 provide the spiritual basis for
 scientism. Religion is viewed
 in lens of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism
 where statements are disproved
 by debate and rational reasoning:
 Logico-Scholastic approach tends
 to focus on reducing the scope
 of inquiry(reductionism) and
 finding contradiction/fallacy,
 exemplified by New Atheism.
 
7.Rationalism: Scientism adherents
 adopt most rationalist positions
 as long as their position is
 non-threatening to social harmony
  and existing moral order:
Scientism will try to replace
'irrational beliefs' with moral
reasoning from secular humanism
 and modern democratic movements.
 
 8.Progressivism:
 Scientism is naturally opposed
 to all forms of conservative
 politics, which in turn adopt
 anti-intellectual/anti-academic
  belief. Progressive politics
  of Scientism is fueled by
  belief in 'March of Progress'
 in which history is shaped by
 technological advances and breakthrough,
 however their social-economic
 positions tend to be more conservative:
 poverty and environmental decay are 
 seen as required steps for 'future progress'
 that will solve the social ills in
 a swift manner(Singularitanism, a
 a subset of Scientism, focuses
 on AI replacing human control) or
  reduces their impact significantly(
  Futurism,trickle-down-technology,
  green energy).
  
9.Atheism and Secular Humanism: Scientism is often
allied with Atheism(and New Atheism)
sharing ideological positions
mentioned above and adopts most
of ideas in Secular Humanism. However,
beliefs in AI deities(Superintelligent AI),
Virtual Reality equivalence to
Physical reality, scientific
progress justifying moral transgressions,
and similar non-humanistic ideas
 labeled as 'cold rationalism'
 alienate many atheists and
 secular humanists.
