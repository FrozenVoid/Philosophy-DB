Media polarization is a stratified system
of politically aligned media outlets 
that appeal to specific platform,
creating a inter-media information war:
A "media circus" where opposite sides
try to discredit and diminish validity of 
other side claims instead of debating
or investing any claim, which are labeled
as propoganda or dismissed as misinfo/disinfo.

The problem the "media circus" you can't
have a nuanced, rational position without
angering hyper-polarized camps of the "circus" who
live in media bubbles that treat each 
other as misguided heretics as best and inhuman monsters as usual.
"Both sides are wrong/right" is a losing 
position that gains no favors and adds 
only risks as it attacks something a
camp has settled on as emotional paradigm that defines their identity:
they are "right/good/correct" because they subscribe to their idea and rejecting the emotional coloring of idea
 in favor of critical thinking will seen as betraying their principles
 and losing the audience sympathy.
