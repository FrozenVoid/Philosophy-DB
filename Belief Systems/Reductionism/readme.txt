Reductionism is a belief system
 that transforms a worldview
 e.g. Materialism, into a simpliefied
  scheme where properties and qualities
  of object of study are properties/qualities 
  of its parts(Reductionist materialism).

Example:
A biological organism would be defined
exclusively by its
 DNA as molecular self-replicating robot
 without any individual characteristic
  that can't be explained by its memory
  and environment. 

Reductionism is the opposite of Holism:
the belief that whole is greater
than sum of its parts and can have
 emergent/unique properties not found
 in its composition but in its configuration.
 
Reductionism have great explanatory
 power if the studied system is 
 not much more complex than its parts,
 but begins to expirience difficulties
 explaining complexity as it arises,

Science and Reductionism:

Science is heavily reductionist in its
 research, often discounting systemic 
 influences and environmental conditions 
 that scientists try to minimize as 'bias'
  to achieve neutrality to extrapolate later, 
  as 'average spherical cow in vaccuum'
  as perfect object of study, which
 minimizes complexity of research,
 allowing easily to hypothesize about 
 influence of variables and environment
 as controlled expansion of reductionist model.
Scientists cannot handle complexity 
without abstracting out difficult parts
of the system in favor of gaining insight
into components, 'researching what is easy'
 and 'researching what is funded'.

Science is driven by funding, which
is inherently reductionist in its 
assesement of 'valuable research'.
