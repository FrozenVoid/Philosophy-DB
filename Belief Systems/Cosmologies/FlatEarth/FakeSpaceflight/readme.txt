A bizzare conspiracy theory that claims spaceflight and space
are fake(including all countries/sattelites/etc), which is combined
with Flat Earth cosmology.
Usually supported by suspicious/unclear images of items/astronauts in space,
implying a fake photoshoot invalidates all spaceflight as fictions.
Supporters of the theory continue to use GPS navigation but invent
various contradicting explanations on its nature(e.g. radio/cell towers)
