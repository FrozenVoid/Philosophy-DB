If you're arguing with flat earth proponents,
the best angle to explore is their conception of antarctica
being larger than the entire world:
in Flat Earth cosmology the circumnavigation of Antarctica 
would be longest circle circumnavigation path on Earth
(its not in reality) as Flat Earth Antarctica surrounds
the Flat Earth oceans with their continents in their cosmology.
