Population size conspiracies are usually a constructed reality(a cosmological belief),
where statistics are fake and real population size is drastically different(i.e.
excluding "undocumented citizens/immigrants" which is acknowledged)
by at least an order of magnitude. Often related to shape-of-earth conspiracies.

Lower population size demography "truman show world":
statistics are faked to gain political advantage in voting and public pressure power.

Larger population size demography "hidden humanity":
statistics exclude most of humanity living in hiding or enslaved by elites.
