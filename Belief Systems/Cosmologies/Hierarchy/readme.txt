A hierarchial cosmology is a system of belief where
 each plane has a plane below and plane above, which are either inferior or superior to it.
This type of cosmology is simplistic "linear-scale" power ladder where
unique qualities of each plane are reduced to a single "level", i.e. discarding the influence
of each plane in favor of "spiritual rank" where a superior plane is always better.
Most religions subscribe to this type of cosmology with "ranks of heavens/hells"
 applied to local plane-system.
