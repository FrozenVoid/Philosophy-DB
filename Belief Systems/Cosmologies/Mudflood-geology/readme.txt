mudflood geology is a conspiracy theory that previous civilizations 
were wiped out by 'mud flood'(a large scale event similar to   Biblical Flood geology) or alternatively a major historical coverup
 occured that is exposed by buildings having extra floors below ground(usually due to sinking foundations see https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/sinking-foundation/ ).
 Usually accompanied by images of old semi-sunken/excavated buildings 
 and references to Tartarian Empire.
