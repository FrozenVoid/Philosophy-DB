Fatalistic chaos or fatalistic anarchy,
is the idea that as fate is predetermined(
in various approached to determinism)
any action has equal moral weight and
nothing stop anyone from complete unhinged
chaos, as its been fatalistically 'right',
i.e. following fate.

This stands in contrast with fatalistic
apathy:no action is actually worth it,
as without freewill it will happen on its
own and desire to act isn't belonging to
the individual, but cast by fate in advance.
