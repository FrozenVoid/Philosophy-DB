Purity-based morality uses pure/impure as fundamental
polarities, however unlike (social) good/evil
polarity concepts, the purity is an energetic
 perception judgement(e.g. 'unclean force' vs 'evil')
 that doesn't make 'moral goodness' pure:
 i.e. good can be 'chaotic/impure'(vigilantism),
 while evil could be 'ordered/pure'(e.g. machine
 algorithm).

Purity of energy/intent/matter is 
 absence of corrupted elements/components/qualities
 as defined by 'pure form', an abstract
 ideal form to which a reified form can be
 compared: 'pure gold' contains only atoms of gold,
 'pure blue color' reflects only blue spectral line,
 'pure emotion' is without dependence on personal qualities.
 
 Simplicity vs Purity:
 although purity is often simple, it doesn't
 grant simplicity->purity due its form or composition,
 as purity requires lack of chaotic and variable
 qualities that can be present in simple
 concepts. 
 
 Order/Chaos: Purity is generally ordered
 and stable,
 but some pure concepts e.g. 'pure chaos'
 that is 'chaos that is competely independent,
 self-sustaining process' qualifies as deserving
 of such label as its not corrupted by any
 non-chaos elements, fully aligned with the
 mental plane form of 'Chaos'.
