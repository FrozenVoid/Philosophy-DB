Black and White morality
 ensures from dualistic worldview
  where good and evil are locked
   into eternal struggle, 
   tied with religion or local myth.
Actions are judged separately
from outcomes and their 'color'
is equivalent to 'intent'.


Color:
i.e. a good action with bad intent
will be Black color.
Any moral failure/flaw/defect colors 
the action/result as Black:
e.g. feeling bad about an action will
in this system adds negative character

Absolute Good:
B&W morality doesn't have compromises
with integrity & character of action.
e.g. A lie to good cause in B&W
is still a bad action due deception.

Absolute Evil:
B&W polarizes actions to 
have worst possible interpretation
by rejecting 'lesser evil' principle
in favor of 'moral perfectionism'.
In such approach all evil is 'greater evil'
and will be equally punished.
