'Good survives,evil perishes' is a pseudo-evolutionary
 fatalistic axiom common to many traditional 
 belief systems: it is the basis for
theistic doctrines that imply death as form
of judgement and survival is favor from the god(s).

This form of moral axiom, survives as arguments
for existence of traditions("if X was evil it would
not survive"),popularity("if X was evil it would
not spread") and customs("if we do X and it was 
evil, it would not perpetuate itself").
Casually the survival axiom hinges on
the concept of 'just world' where 
infallible moral agents(e.g.gods)
actively punish and eradicate evil,
which is definetely at odds with all historical
 and religious history, that allows evil
 either as 'test of will to prevail'
 or 'temptation as basis
 for future punishment' forms of divine judgement,
 that both exclude the idea of interference
 that doesn't remedy the problem:
 the evil survives and good perishes, but
 the tradition justifies it as legal trap
 that will spring in future life
 or afterlife as evil is ultimately
 punished: however this negates the 
 survival axiom as it applies to material
  chain of events, that is 'survival of
 moral good' is not achieved by post-factum
 divine judgement.
