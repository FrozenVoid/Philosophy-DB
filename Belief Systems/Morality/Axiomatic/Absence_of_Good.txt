The fundamental absence of good as 
moral foundation, e.g. evolutionary pressure
for predation and overall design of chemical
life, indicates the world has no moral
foundation and it requires effort to
construct a moral order out of chaos.

Legalistic approach:
The idea of lack of fundamental goodness
is central to Gnosticism(local god isn't
good but global god is)
and Maltheism(the global god is not good) where
morality is defined by divine authority:
i.e. purely legalistic vs value judgement.

Compromise approach:
Balance of good and evil:
The world evil is justified due energetic
balance of polar opposites.

Justification approach:
Evil is justified due karmic debt,
flawed actions or collective responsibility.

Humanistic utilitarian:
It good to pretend fundamental goodness
is present in the design of the world,
as its absence would compromise humanity:
e.g. belief in Greater Good

Fatalism:
Evil is predetermined as paths of fate,
superdeterminism removes all free will and
evil/good are temporary emotional judgement
with no fundamental moral value as it does
not exist outside of mental constructs(
constructivist) or sociall enforced(legalistic).
