The most noticed trait of karma
system is that it treats 
'good deeds'(better vs worse)
or 'progress'/'improvement'
in morality as deserving of 
bad karma, which inevitably applies.

type of counters to this proposition:
1.Elemental reaction:
Karma is amoral, energetic
 response to any action with
  reaction. Good vs evil are 
  not even considered.

2.Gnostic approach:
Karma system is ruled by same corrupted
 entities that designed the material world.

3.Absolutist morality:
'good deeds' are judged as bad,
due absolute moral value of good as 
'having a purely 100% good deed' 
or 'doing evil', with relatively
 good deeds judged as evil.

4.Entropic reaction/Reactive chaos:
Karma is anti-entropy justice
mechanism to punish any action
 that increases entropy/chaos/complexity.
