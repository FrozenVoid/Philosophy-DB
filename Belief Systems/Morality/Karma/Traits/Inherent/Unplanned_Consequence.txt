Due limited knowledge and foresight, the karmic
debt that accumulates goes without the 
karmic agent intent: there is no reasonable 
future-knowledge to prevent an unknown effect
so the karma is inherently unfair in this aspect:
the moral equation of "Knowingly commiting bad action
 gathers negative consequence" does even work
 due material limitations of 'free' agents mind:
 A.Lack of belief: the agent often lacks
 sufficient belief in the gravity of own actions.
 B.Lack of expected knowledge: ignorance leads one
 to assume no bad consequences or reprercussions exist.
 C.Lack of foresight/planning: the action of free agent
 is often unplanned or dictated by circustances
 that defy/limit ability to plan in advance.
 D.Lack of free will: an agent forced to perform
 an action due lack of options or knowledge of
 alternatives, will move by default path towards
 negative consequence he cannot prevent.
