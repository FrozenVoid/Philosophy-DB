Counterbalance or "Balance of Good and Evil"
is a dualistic interpretation of karmic resolution.
In the counterbalance interpretation,
the negative karma creates a negative balance,
which when adjusted to zero by negative action
neutralizes both negative karma and
 counterbalancing
  negative action karmic weight:
  which normally would increase to the party
  resolving the karma.

Problems with counterbalance interpretation:
1.Consequence-free action for the resolving
 agent. Either
 1.A.Free will is absent in such action.
 1.B.Karmic debt is diminished but increases
 propensity to disrupt energy flow towards 
 accumulating bad karma(downward spiralling).
2.The draw balance assumes the universe wants
 'perfect neutrality' where all karma is resolved,
 however existence of Samsara itself depends
 on ever-accumulating karmic debt.
