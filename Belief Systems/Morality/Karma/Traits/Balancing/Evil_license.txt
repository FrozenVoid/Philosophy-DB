The karma system enables evil
(negative traits/events/entities) 
to exist, as karmic retribution 
requires some 'evil agent' to 
accomplish karmic resolution(and
 in turn be punished for it);
i.e. karma itself is a license 
to evil.

Karmic justic is inherently 
retributive(eye-for-an-eye) which
requires a counterparent 
karmic actor that will resolve 
'karmic balance': this means 
karma enables evil to perpetuate
and spiral out as 'evil side' will
in turn require another 'karmic balance'
resolution, which involves more
 evil actions to punish the original evil.
