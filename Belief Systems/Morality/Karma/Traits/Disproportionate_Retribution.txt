An event like a flap of butterfly
 wing's will lead to disproportionate
  karmic retribution(a hurricane 
  for a flap of wings) as 
 karma snowballs from small 
 events into systemic downward
 spirals easily: the opposite
idea of 'accumulating luck' is much
rarer encountered.
  
  
Related proverb that demonstrated
the 'downward spiraling' of 
karmic retribution:
â€œFor want of a nail the shoe 
was lost. For want of a shoe 
the horse was lost. For want
of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the battle
was lost. For want of a battle
the kingdom was lost. And all
for the want of a horseshoe nail."
