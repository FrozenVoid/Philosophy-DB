In corruption model karma the moral questions
are absent: the mere energetic color of any action
colors the agent's aura and subtle bodies in a 
form of corruption/purification balance,
with negative action being those which corrupt
the subtle bodies and positive those which
purify them of corruption or refine their
substance/energy(e.g. purifying mental body by
thinking/focusing purifying thoughtforms)

vs Intent morality:
While outwardly corruption-model karma looks
similar to intent-based morality, the deeper
and refined energetic context defines this
form of karma as distinct from morality based
karma:
1.Energy color/frequency is inherently amoral
and defies utilitarian-polar classification:
a negative emotion could be corrupting(as expected with intent karma)
but it could be liberating/purifying/shedding karma by its expression(like tears),
so context and setting are important factors.

2.Negative energy is not morally evil/bad
like Yang/Yin balance is not about good and evil.
Negative karma could have positive consequence,
allowing redemption/rectification/refinement
which would rebuild the person more immune
to further negative karma of this type:
e.g. learning that small bad action is bad,
preventing larger action of same kind.


3.Corrupted energy colors(e.g. black karma) 
is not itself based on intent or state, it
is inherent with the action/environment;
 wearing black clothes isn't morally bad;
yet energetically it attracts black-color karma,
which is extreme Yin and corrupts Yang characteristics by its mere presence;
However wearing such negative-corrupting
karma is merely due black absorbing nearby
(corrupted) energy of environment and would
be beneficial in form of gathering energy
or absorbing it from the personal emanation
(e.g. corrupted energy emanations of a person absorbed
by his own clothes and discarded)
