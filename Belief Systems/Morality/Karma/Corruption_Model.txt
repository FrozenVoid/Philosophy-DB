In corruption model karma the moral questions
are absent: the mere energetic color of any action
colors the agent's aura and subtle bodies in a 
form of corruption/purification balance,
with negative action being those which corrupt
the subtle bodies and positive those which
purify them of corruption or refine their
substance/energy(e.g. purifying mental body by
thinking/focusing purifying thoughtforms)
