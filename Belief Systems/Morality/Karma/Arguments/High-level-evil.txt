The existence of evil at 
higher planes and positions of
authority contradicts karmic
fairness: such evil entities
would quickly accumulate extremely
negative karma and reincarnate
as lowest, least-powerful entities.
Since reality is contrary to
observation, several explanations
of 'evil in authority' exist:

A.Karma is absent.
B.Karma only applies to specific
planes.
C.Karma system uses evil entities
as punishment.
D.Karmic houdinis: entities
creates anti-karmic counters to
prevent karmic debt.
E.Artificial karma: karma is imposed
by entities who operate above it,
with evil entities simply at their
level.
F.Karmic trap: evil entities
accumulate irreversible karmic
debt for some reason allowed
by system.
