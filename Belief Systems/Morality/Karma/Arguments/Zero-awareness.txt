For a punishment to make sense
 there has to be:
 1.Awareness of crime
 2.Awareness of specific law
 3.Fair application of law
 Karma fails all three
 1.Reincarnation system erases
 all awareness of past crimes,
 thus making it 'unknown factor'
 that lacks any justice for a
 person that didn't expect it.
 
 2.Karma works without awareness
 of what crime is committed or
 what system is in effect,
 what past transgressions exist,
 what legal status is in effect.
 Blind, mysterious changes of karma
  cannot be explained or argued for,
  except as fatalistic explanation.
 
 3.With absence of information
 application of justice cannot be
 fair and consistent for everyone.
 Karma is completely hidden and
 is non-obvious in its mechanics
 as they occur in each case:
 only a vague moral sense protects
  from karmic debt(and not always).
