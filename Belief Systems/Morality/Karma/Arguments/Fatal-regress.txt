The argument usually takes the following
form: at any time A the entire
 karma for the moment was generated
 by previous moment B,
 thus at some point the 
 future karma of person was generated
 at birth by the parents,
 and in turn their karma was 
 generated by their own parents,
 thus shifting karmic responsibility
 further back in time, and
 making current moment completely
  dependent on the past karma.
  
 Counters:
 1.Limits of karmic influence:
 A limit of karma extending to
  responsible party lifespan
 with death serving as disconnection
 from the world.
 
 2.Shared burden: past karma 
 only takes a part in pre-generated 
 karma with circumstance and
  character traits determining
  the rest.
 
 3.Super-determinism:
 All karma is already pre-generated
 as if reality was evolving 
 cellular automata: usually 
 some form of hard fatalism is
  used as foundational belief,
 with free-will being downplayed
 as factor or proclaimed as illusory.
