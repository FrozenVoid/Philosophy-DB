Karmic burden if counting 
from birth and ignoring influence
of past lifes is established
in childhood, like a first layer
of bricks laid by a mason.
In bad environment or lacking oversight
 children quickly accumulate bad karma,
 without the slightest idea or 
 sense of responsibility:
 the karmic burden they begin to build
  is alien to them and decision come
   largely from instinctual/emotional
   reaction to their situation.
   
  The argument against Karmic justice
  system is as following:
  1.Children easily build bad karma
  without understanding the effects.
  2.Karma tends to spiral out in direction
  of previous karma.
  3.Therefore Karmic justice system 
  is invalid due
   punishing innocent free choice
   in situation where moral 
   judgement is absent/flawed or
 lacking in depth.
 
In addition the karmic burden
of location and circumstances already
generate a strong 'mainline' path
to same level of karmic burden of
individual, that negates all moral
value of karma as justice.

Usual counters to this debacle are:
A.Karma is not about morality,
but a system reaction/feedback to action.
The 'non-moral' karma is a rare
but sharp critique of the system
as underlying elemental inbalances
and energy states have no innate
morality or 'human-level' judgement
power, they just represent a configuration 
of subtle bodies.


B.Karma is about morality, and
children's karmic foundation is 
justified due past lives transgression.
In this counter-argument the 
the determinism of environment is
essentially an application of 
collective punishment for '
people with similar past life karmic burden'
i.e. a 'one-size-fits all' penalty.

C.Children are actually ignoring
innate moral senses in favor of
 emotional satisfaction.
 (The 'evil children' argument often
 takes the aspect of 'children are evil by default'
 citing supervision/culture/feral children 
 as supporting arguments)
