For karma to be a fair system
(fair doesn't imply good) there
has to be no random factors 
influencing it: if a random factor
exists - the karma for it will be
based on random event, thus unfair
to the victim of karma.
Therefore a fair karma system
would only work in fully deterministic
universe/plane system.

Counters:
1.Karma is partially fair:
This disqualifies most karmic
morality as based on randomness.
2.Randomness is caused by 
prior karma: i.e. deterministic
 universe.
