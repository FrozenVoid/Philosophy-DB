The common, average karma is 
often a downward spiral that 
pulls down the 'shared karma' into
the lowest state in the plane.

This means the karmic system is
essentially an entrapment device
that lowers average karma(average men)
by shared karma(of group) as
inevitably one of group will
create some karmic burden.

Counters:
1.All in this together:
The karma enforces collective
responsibility through collective
 punishment(shared karma) of 
 individual members(average karma)
 in a group/society.

2.Interconnected system/Grey-to-Grey:
All karma is shared as everything
influences the entire system,
which balances karma of evil/good  
entities with common,average karma.
