The common idea that
each 'free choice' splits the 
timeline into multiple paths
with each evolving in separate direction:
the essence of this is explaining
 karma as consequence of choices
 shaping the 'personal timeline'
 where spirit observes the timeline
 of its current mindstream(that 
 does not prevent viewing alternative
 timelines).
 
Counter-arguments:
1.Lack of central agent:
each split timeline has its own
 choice-maker forced to take
 the 'local timeline choice'
refuting free will in the choice.

2.Proliferation of worlds:
amount of worlds generated
from this karmic splitting
will exponentially increase 
to near-infinite level very fast.

3. Lack of morality:
If all choices are equally valid
for timeline generation,
there is no point in choosing,
since the 'bad timeline' will always
occur in grand scheme of reality.

This 'choose your own timeline'
 foundation is hidden in many 
 moral systems as 'you determine
 your reality/karma with free will'
 as if limited free choice
 isn't deterministic and predictable:
 the requirement for moral responsibility
  generates demand for explaining
  the non-deterministic 'moral choice'
  or 'free choice' existing.
