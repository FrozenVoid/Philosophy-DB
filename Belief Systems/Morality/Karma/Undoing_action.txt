Undoing action is redirection
of karmic sequence towards neutral
state or status quo, that reduces
karmic burden long-term: the 
action itself may cause lesser 
karmic burden to manifest.

Undoing action actively defuses
karmic burden unlike non-doing 
which passively waits/accepts
existing karmic burde.
