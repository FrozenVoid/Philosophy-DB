Intent & motive-based morality
systems usually employ the idea
 that "good intentions" are primary
  quality of an act:
  i.e. bad acts for a good outcome:
 "the ends justiry the means".
 Since intent is internally constructed
 people judge  "what the person intended"
 as their plan('the ends') to do X.
The same problem with B&W morality:
'color' of intent is subjective
judgement & trust in the integrity 
of character that ascribes moral
qualities to external appearances 
& shallow impressions of good-will.
Intent-based morality is opposite
to useful/harmful & utilitarian models,
as it values the 'means' rather
than 'ends'.
