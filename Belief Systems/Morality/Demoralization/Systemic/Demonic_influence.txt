Most of demoralization is done
by non-physical, demonic entities, though 
demoralized humans under their
control also
 work to this end. The demoralization
 never fixes anything or 
 reforms the person it just 
 annihilates inner morality and
 sense of conscience that makes
 people degrade into 
 'rationalistic automatons'
 following the crowd and authority
 of the moment.

Types of such convictions:
1.The most common trick of rhetoric
is conviction of 'evil world nature'
 that leads one to embrace evil and
 become a part of such a 'world',
 irrelevance of morality(no good or evil)
 and embrace of 'might is right'.
 

2.Lack of advancement argument:
the person is convinced he must
turn to evil and abandon morality
to advance/prosper.

3.Unfair world deserving unfair
treatment: the person is convinced
their actions are justified by
presence of greater evil or 
corruption that are negating 
smaller/lesser evils of own design.

4.True nature of the world as
hierarchy of strong ruling weak:
the person is convinced to become
 stronger in hierarchy by any means
 as he now views his place in hierarchy
 as undeserved and undignified.
