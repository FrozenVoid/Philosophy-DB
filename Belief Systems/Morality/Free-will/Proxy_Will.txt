A proxy will is a form of 'free will' which
appears as both free and non-controllable.
Imagine an entity with a mind, inhabiting
a body with free will: the body is chaotically
influenced and 'free' to choose, but mind
only views the effects without control:
e.g. 'observer consciousness'.

Multi-level proxy wills:
Further proxy levels of 'free thoughts/feelings/sensations'
observed after they occur in the body
and reach the mind(through intermediate
brain filters and transformers).
Each of these layers could technically 
be capable of 'free will' without any
control of the 'observer consciousness',
thus absolving it of 'free will burden'.
