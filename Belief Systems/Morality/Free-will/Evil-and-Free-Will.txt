As the planes go higher their
entities gain more free will,
(an examples is lucid dreaming 
 editing as reality warping power:
 this 'warping' is proportional
 to energy available on the plane)
 with which the plane tolerance 
 to evil(negative, downward planar)
 action increases: this might
 explain why more 'refined' higher
 planes harbor more evil entities
 and actions.
