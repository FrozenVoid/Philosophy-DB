Free Choice: Morality of Free Will

Free choice is a limited version
of freewill that is completely
deterministic.
A person is given options to choose
 from, person used reasoning to pick
 one of options.
There is no actual free will,
(outside of lucid dream/astral projection
 editing of reality), yet timelines
 can be changed.
Choice is usually not random,
can be predicted(unlike unconscious actions)
 and usually results from mental models
 processing the options present:
i.e. a robot with same models
will make the same choice.

Exceptions:
Lucid dreams, in lucid dreams
the reality is purely mental
where all unconscious/conscious
 acts are possible - closest 
 to actual free will.
Astral/mental projections,
 fantasies and imagination allow
 exercise of free will limited
by capability of mind:
e.g. a decision to draw a tree
will allow unconscious action
to present a mental image into reality
that isn't a choice but also
 isn't 'free' in sense of being
consciously 'willed into existence',
as the mental image is product
of unconscious and subconscious processes
 that get recorded and replayed.
