If multiple entities have free will
 they could infringe on each others
 Free Will thus make it not-absolute,
This demonstrates that free will 
can't be absolute without
limiting it to a single entity.
Such entity will be also limited
by its mental capability 
and energy to exercises such Free Will
that mean in practice the idea
of Absolute Free Will is absurd.
