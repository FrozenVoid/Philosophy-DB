This type of morality is
usually based on strict utilitarian
  approach(typically rooted in science)]
  which judges acts
  as either useful or harmful to 
  society(or human group in question).
  Logically, morality is 
  reduced to value function of action
   outcome that rejects the character
    of action in favor 
    "the ends justify the means".
  It will diverge from utilitarianism
  when convienient(as usefullness
  can be subjectively judged)
