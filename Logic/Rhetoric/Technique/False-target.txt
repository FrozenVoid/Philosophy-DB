False target is a set of techniques to redirect
debate into areas where the orator's position remains untouched,
i.e. wasting opposing side time to chase imaginary points and proofs.
The false is usually compared to a concept of "thread derailing",
but unlike thread manipulation the 'false target' is connected
with some aspect of orator's position that is promoted as
important and essential, while in fact its status is irrelevant
to the position-at-large, being a background detail or factoid without
 much influence on the position itself.

False targets source material is usually some emotionally
 sensitive topic with wide social resonance that would promote
 lots of useless emotionallly-charged debate,
 but will not change the impact of overall position promoted:
 where a logical argument would be harmful, the false target
  redirection will overtake it in public importance.
