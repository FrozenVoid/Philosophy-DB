Ungrateful/Spoiled modernity is
a temporal comparison technique
that is a polar opposite of
"Good Old Days".

Method: dismiss the subject
 problems as insignificant and
 not worth discussing by contrast
 with past problems.

Typical forms:
"N years ago we didn't have X,
be grateful you have X(don't complain
about X)"
"In my time, we only have Y option,
so be grateful that you even have choice"
"Why are you complaining about X,
N years ago we only had Y"

The rhetoric opens the moral issue
of a specific problem from the perspective
 of a inferior quality of life place or time,
taking the 'average human life' 
as standard of comparison:
the comparison doesn't take 
 any circumstances in account,
 effectively claiming that
 'a peasent should be grateful for
  his status',as the argument could
 be applied recursively,
 until we reach 'monkeys/rats had it worse'
 "think of the horrors lobe-finned
  fish faced all day, and be grateful
  you can live on land and breath air you spoiled simian!"
  etc, demonstrating the absurdity
  of time travel morality.
