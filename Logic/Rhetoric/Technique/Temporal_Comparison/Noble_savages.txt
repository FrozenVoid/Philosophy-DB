A cultural comparison of 
imagined "Golden Age" inevitably
descends into civilization critique:
this argument applies idealized
 image of past 'savage tribes' 
 as counter to complex/corrupt 
 modernity, usually taking great
 effort to never mention modern
 savages(tribal societies still exist
 in incredible poverty and suffering).
 
 Noble savage is essentially 
 an argument that purity requires
 material hardships, (i.e. poverty
 and lack of technology) to build
 an ideal society: the social ills
 of complex,psychologically damaging
  society are highlighted as unnatural
  and contrary to spirit, usually
  ignoring the complexity of primitive
   tribes and their impact on nature:
 the facts that noble savages of the past which
  destroyed megafauna and burned forests
  to ashes without any notion of 
  'respect to nature' or 'natural order'
  are dismissed in favor of fantasy
   heroics and moral purity of living
   in harmony with nature: 
   Comparisons with feral children,
    monkeys and mentally deficient
    invididuals are carefully avoided,
    as their existence threatens the
    idealized 'noble savage' image(that is their anti-intellectual hero opposing modernity)
