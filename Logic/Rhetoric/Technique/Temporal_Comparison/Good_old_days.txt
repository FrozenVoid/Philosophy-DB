"Good old days" rhetoric,
also known as "Golden Age" in
the past is a popular temporal
comparison for conservatives and
 people emulating the past,
 usually dimissing past problems
 in favor of grandiose 'historical
  fantasy' imagined as ideal past
  (Golden Age).

Method: highlights the superiority
of past time period, usually
 proclaiming moral values have
 degenerated(though life quality comparison
 sometimes occur).
 
Typical forms:
"We should fall back to time period X morality,
it has more Y quality that present lacks
"In the past, we never had problem X,
this proves how degenerate/inferior/rotten
 the present is"
"This is a problem we never had,
didn't you wish for simpler days/
understand how bad it become"
"Back then, you could be doing X or Y,
without any problem"
"Before year X, there wasn't any Y"

Many variants of "Good Old Days"
 stress how the speaker aligns
 with the past period and its moral
 values, opposing progress as 
 morally inferior/degenerate path.
The speaker often wants to
 make the audience nostalgic for
 a period they have little 
accurate knowledge on, using motifs 
from fiction and biased sources
which glorify specific past aspects 
as cultural fundament to establish
'ideal past' to which society must
 return.
