Temporal comparison typically
take the following forms
A.The past was better, this is 
worse: also known as "Good Old Days"
B.The past was worse, be grateful
for current progress and prosperity:
also known as "Ungrateful modernity/Spoiled modernity"
C.The future will be better,
the current stuff is not worth it:
 "Lets wait for brighter future".
D.The future will be worse,
better enjoy what you have:
"Cherish your days/time here".

All these temporal arguments are
a form of sophistry that generalizes
 circumstances and conflates everything
  as monolithic "past/future place"
  ascribed qualities of author intent:
  the specific are usually cherry 
  picked and contrary qualities/properties
  of time period are ignored in favor
  of focus on pet issues at hand.
