The technique usually takes the
form of 'expirience justifies the argument',
using the speaker qualifications
and N years of expirience in X to
advance any position he desires,
with critics often asked for their expirience
in X and dismissed as inadequate/inferior
to speaker breadth of knowledge in X.

The problem is that expirience
does not imply competence or
 depth of knowledge, only time/effort
 spent on the subject.
The qualities of expirience don't
 magically grant expertise or proficiency.
