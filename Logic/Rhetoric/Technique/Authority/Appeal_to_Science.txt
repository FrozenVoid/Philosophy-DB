Appeal to science/"Believe in Science"
is a dismissal technique that 
 uses dogmatic fundament of
 'pure, uncorrupted Science'
 (a neutral authority as imagined by public)
 as a shared-value ideological appeal
 that sidesteps valid critique
 in favor of blind faith,
 usually hiding the equivalent of 
 'peasants shouldn't
 question priests on religion' 
 applied to modern day.
