The   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument

The premise is that privacy is inherently
secretive, semi-criminal and unnecesary for "ordinary people".
The easiest counterargument is:
that they(the anti-privacy advocates)
A.wear non-transparent clothes. 
B.Don't reveal their address and full name online. 
C.Don't reveal their entire personal
  history when prompted.

All these prove they do have something to hide,
and its hypocritical to demand abolishing
encryption/privacy/secrecy/etc at whim of
"public knowledge".
