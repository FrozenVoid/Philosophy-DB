A Strawman supporter is a pretending debater that
supports your position but exhibits the worst qualities
associated with it in public imagination/perception,
effectivelly adding bad reputation to the position promoted.

Strawman supporters usually operate using 'Reductio ad absurdum'
 method, though without logical interest - only to paint the position 
 at its worst possible light: 
Strawman supporters end up taking the most
extreme possible arguments/position on the topic
arguing to amplify most controversial points to their fullest extent.

False Ally can turn into Strawman Supporters where they
seem outmaneuvered in honest debate and wish to sabotage it,
usuing emotionally charged escalation or misdirection where
they turn themselves into caricatures of your position.
