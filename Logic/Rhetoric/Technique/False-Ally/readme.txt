This is a term to describe positions that agree
on the surface with your own, that later expand to something
completely different justified by circumstances or logic.

Typically the writer/orator(This technique is mostly used in written media) describes a vague 
"common sense" position(argumental basis) that
is reasonably secure from attack and agrees with your own,
in order to create a false sense of security which it gradually
attacks, using weak points of that position to expand to alternative
position that is completely different,
using emotional pressure & rhetorical devices to convince you
that position is "upgraded" to a valid alternative point
(which original position opposes, but weakened by rhetoric of "false ally").
