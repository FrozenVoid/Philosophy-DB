A contradictory proposition that is assuming
that one category is compatible
with another.e.g. a square circle.

Logical impossibility: 
A is both true and false.
A implies that A is B and not A.
A has property X and Y, X implies
that A cannot have Y and vice versa.

Reaching category mismatch usually
disproves the initinal assumptions:
reductio ad absurdum arguments and
logical fallacies in general rely
on category mismatch to refute propositions.
