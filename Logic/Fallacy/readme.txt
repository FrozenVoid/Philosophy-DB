Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that make arguments unsound(due dependence on a logical fallacy).
The underlying basis of an argument may hold a value(such as inductive reasoning/probability/pattern being detected), but relying on a fallacy compromises the argument's structure and makes the arguer look deceptive(by forcing an error into discussion).
A typical form of most fallacies is "arguer thinks A implies B because C" when such factors are independent/unrelated regardless if A or B both hold the same truth value or not.
