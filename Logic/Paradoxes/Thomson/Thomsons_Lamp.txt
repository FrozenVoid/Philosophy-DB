The paradox stem from the idea that
series of 1+1/2^n+1/2^(n+1) sum to 2,
which is always below 2 and the genie
will switch the lamp on/off forever:
the series cannot converge to 2, only decrease
the infinitesimal distance from 1/2 to 1/2^n->inf
that allow space to turn the lamp on/off
at each 1/2^n step ad infinitum.

Note:as with most such paradoxes, treating
infinitesimals as zeros due Archimedean property
 considered axiomatic leads to similar absurd 
 conclusions.
