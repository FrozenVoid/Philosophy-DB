``If everything when it occupies an equal space 
is at rest at that instant of time, and if that
which is in locomotion is always occupying 
such a space at any moment, the flying arrow
is therefore motionless at that instant of
time and at the next instant of time
but if both instants of time are taken
as the same instant or continuous
instant of time then it is in motion``

The paradox stems from flawed definition
of a moment as 0-length time period,
at which speed is multiplied by 0-len and
appears zero at infinetesimal length(which is not).

Resolution: define moment as 1/n seconds
and measure time K on it as period of
arrow flight, then increase n to arbitrary
amount and observe proportional distance(K-dependent) reduction
that DOES not change speed which is independent of K period(distance/speed=K):As 1/n approaches zero speed does not change,K and distance just decreases to infinitesimal numbers(as in 1-0.999...)

Note:rejection of reality of infinitesimals due Archimedean property treated as axiom is source of many
such paradoxes where infinitesimal quantities
are treated as zero quantity and multiplied/transformed to reveal the actual quantity.
