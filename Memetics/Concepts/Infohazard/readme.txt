Infohazard is a information piece and its container that has detrimental effects
on the person who consumes it. Unlike a 'plain meme', the infohazard is not mutating or conforming
to a local belief/culture,but instead reconfigures the local belief/culture. Infohazards have the capability of reconfiguring the mind of reader
and turning its energy towards the subject of infohazard.

Infohazards can be broadly divided into the following:
A.Religious infohazard: Cult-like content that drives its adherents to promote belief system beneficial to the infohazard content spread.
Such Infohazard can faciliate possession states, religious conversion, spiritual expiriences and spiritual crisis by simply being absorbed as true information.
Infohazard is more potent where a belief system is weak, if a belief system has weak points
the infohazard can represent as solution for closing the weak points and subverting the belief
system from within. Subtle bodies('the soul') are changed in frequency and form if infohazard is integrated, as well as human personality traits and habits.

B.Memetic infohazard: Self-replicating content(meme) that promotes own values to spread itselfs(memetic evolution/mutation).
The key danger of such infohazards is their appearance in the mind as insignificant background elements that are not noticed as transformative('conversion expirience') or classified as benign expression of creativity('artistic') or quirk of perception('illusory').
Example: The current 'meme image' trend is a manifestation of 'memetic mutation' infohazard that drives meme-creators to mutate/corrupt content containers of the meme to spread it into new domains/concept-spaces.

C.Cultural infohazard: a content piece which relies on holes in belief system to integrate itself into the culture/subculture it targets, transforming the culture towards a state that is aligned with infohazard values.
Such Infohazard could be ephemereal activity or idea that consumes the culture with pursuit of concepts that infohazard promotes. A videogame that generates specific emotions
that corrupt its player's minds is an example of such infohazard.


D.Emotional infohazard: Such infohazard relies on promoting self-destructive and negative emotions to evoke a weakened mental state where it will be accepted into the cultural substrate of the victim.Melancholy is a potent emotion often exploited by such infohazards.
Emotional infohazard are most diverse in their domains, arts/music/books/video can contain multiple forms of different infohazards at same time. 

E.Moral infohazard: Such infohazard subverts the morality system of victim, usually centered around justifying violations of morality and rationalizations of own weakness/corruption.
Infohazard can be conceptualized as "override sequence"(moral corruption) for a human brain that injects the payload by bypassing mental defenses and morality systems(e.g. the cultural concept of 'war'  justifies/promotes mass murder and crime towards 'enemy').
