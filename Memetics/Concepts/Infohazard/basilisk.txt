A weaponized infohazard that causes brain damage.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLIT_(short_story)
Such a pattern is likely operating as triggering visual illusion that
creates extreme sensory overload and disruption of
memory formation/sensory processing -
e.g. an infinite loop of pattern recognition
on a illusory fractal pattern.
However unlike the fictional story such infohazard wouldn't create
a permanent effect due neuroplasticity.
