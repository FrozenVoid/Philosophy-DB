Voice can be hypnotic and carry a payload that
bypassess rational processing, going into subconscious.
A musical arrangement can amplify hypnotic power
(synchronization of emotional states),
as mind is distacted by musical rhythm
(brainwave entrainment in theta range
is especially potent), allowing songs to embed values/sentiment/suggestion
deep into the victims mind. All popular music is hypnotic,
which encourages repeat listening(brainwashing by repetition):
cultural preferences gradually evolve music 
that is more and more hypnotic/memetic.

Tone of hypnotic voices follows a specific rhythm,
to a musical pattern that is easy to recall,
usually songs use periodic 'hooks'
(hypnotic trigger, pattern that is inherently pleasant)
to space 'filler content'
(hypnotic suggestion, song content that is 'spiced' with hooks)

Gender of voice makes a difference:
Hypnotic voices can be divided into
A.Non-confrontational, evoking sympathy: 
usually female, soft sounding, relaxed tone.
B.Confrontational, evoking aggression:
A harsh-sounding(usually male) voice can
invoke many aggressive patterns, 
with more emphasis on provoking some action which
will act as rhythmic signal with suggestion.

Volume that remains constant:
A voice range that is without sharp peaks or volume changes.
An instrumental-only song can use more range for various
emotional tricks in perception, but lacks hypnotic quality
of 'voice streaming' that requires a constant volume.

Non-irritating content:
Low sibilance,non-irritating monotone rhythm patterns,
lack of 'exotic' accents and random ambience/noises.
