Infomeme is a factoid or short
 statement converted into a memetic
 format(e.g. image macro).
The concept of infomeme is similar
to 'informational posters' 
with infomemes being treated as
an older media adaptation, which
looks out-of-touch in emotion driven
 context. Some forms can be 
 considered stealth advertising
 or morality aesops: they use
 familiar themes as templates
to 'viralize' content with popular formats.
