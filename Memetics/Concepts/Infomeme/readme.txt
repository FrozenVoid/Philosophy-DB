Infomeme is a factoid or short
 statement converted into a memetic
 formar(e.g. image macro).
The concept of infomeme is similar
to 'informational posters' 
with infomemes being treated as
an older media adaptation, which
looks out-of-touch in emotion driven
 context. Some forms can be 
 considered stealth advertising
 or morality aesops.
