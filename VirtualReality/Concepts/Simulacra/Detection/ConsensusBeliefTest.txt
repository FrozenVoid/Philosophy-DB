The idea of "detecting Consensus Belief" is
that simulacra design would make 'consensus belief'
reality due majority expecting reality to
align with the consensus(as within a dream): i.e.
if the most of the world suddenly changed
their consensus to something clearly wrong
e.g. Flat Earth, the simulacra would adapt to
majority belief by making the Earth flat.
The dreamlike power of 'consensus belief' 
of course would require genuine belief and
trust in such change, so a test of consensus
belief would be something that is malleable,
highly dependent on authority and unknowable
to 'consensus belief' masses:
i.e. some belief that is inherently hard to test
reality of but that can be changed by social engineering.

Principle: in a dream, expectation or belief
in something forms the dream content.
Proof of such 'shared dream' based on
consensus belief, would allow to alter the 
simulacra fabric by altering mass belief.
