A placebo ritual test would prove that
some contrived action that is unconnected to
its effect has causal relation with the 'reality'
being tested:e.g. drawing of a coastline shore 
slightly wrong multiple times(ritual) would 
alter the real coastline('simulacra') due both
being simulated on same baseline fabric and having
no real experiental basis(equal in substance)
