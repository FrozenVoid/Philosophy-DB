The test detects 'virtuality' by lack of content
 segregation of its parts:
 in a suspected virtual world, an effect of
 action inside a clearly virtual part(e.g. a video
 game, simulacra) has a real effect that 
 should NOT affect the user(eating virtual food giving
  stomach cramps that the 'current layer' provides).
  
  The 'inverse' is the idea that detecting
  fakeness of 'current layer' is counted on by
  simulacra trying to fool the user in its genuine
  design, but inverse is proving 'realness'
  of 'simulacra',thus proving equality of causal
  event chain in 'reality' and 'simulacra',
  which proves 'reality' is simulated,virtual
  and equal in content quality with the 
  part of it that is suppose to feel fake.
