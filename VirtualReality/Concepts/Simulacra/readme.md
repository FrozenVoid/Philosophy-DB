Simulacra is a symbolic representation of something that exist only because we
interpret the simulacra(e.g. pixels) as components of structure:
essentially it tricks out pattern recognition to "compromise" its suspension disbelief to allow, for  a moment the drawing of an object(e.g. video game sprite) to represent the physical entity behind it(a fictional mushroom) which is distinct from the background objects(which are recognized as low-priority patterns, due being purely graphical as opposed to moving/functional objects).

How we recognize cartoon animals:
The mind assigns to the pixel structure a mental construct corresponding to the interpretation, so a cartoon bunny gets recognized as closest to "bunny-like pattern" even though it has very few common part with a physical bunny,
that is of course because we developed a more abstract pattern of "cartoon bunny" which lacks the detail and functionality of real bunnies.
The scheme of simulacra being fit to pattern:
Bugs Bunny->Cartoon Characters distinct from background:
Pattern recognition assigns Bugs Bunny to Category "cartoon bunny"
Which is conflated in the mind with category "bunnies" and stereotypical 
'average bunny pattern' that is expected of a bunny(Eating carrots, Hiding in holes,etc which Bugs Bunny exhibits to reinforce the pattern).
The whole simulacra category exists, because we have flexible pattern recognition that allows compromises and refitting our assumptions:
a computer would not classify Bugs Bunny as a bunny,
rather there would be a separate category for cartoon animal characters that
 exhibit anthropomorphic features("Anthro") that could be as human-like as they need, while with humans it can't be done without
"breaking character" of 'average bunny pattern'(a more severely restricted form is  Tom&Jerry mimicking  animal tropes of cat&mouse),
The computer program deals in absolutes, so a simulacra and its real analogue must be quite indistinct in features to compete for the same 'pattern recognition' parameters.  A program which would recognize Bugs Bunny as a bunny would exhibit a form of abstract thinking, currently limited to human beings.
More interesting idea, is that we can recognize the pattern of a bunny from very abstract pixel sprites with very little detail and only a slight resemblance to a bunny: the mind can't stand an "unrecognized object" so it settles to "most-probable category" which involves comparisons between patterns:
A question we internally solve each time we find such a pattern:
Is this sprite resembles more of a cartoon bunny, cartoon dog or a cartoon cat?
The idea of a bunny being a tiny pixel sprite has some doubt: so when the art creator clarifies that it is indeed a bunny, the association is reinforced(despite that the sprite could as well depict a cartoon dog).
We learn from authority(art creator) that our pattern recognition is correct and remember this fact as background training model for the next time we see similar things. 

Simulacra(visual object) is denied ambiguity of being an unrecognized category, since we assume it has to fit one of the categories we already know: this isn't
always the case with new expirience, as expression "lacking the words to express it" denotes a situation our pattern recognition engine was dumbstruck and forced to learn new patterns: a second expirience of the same would be recognized as memory event from the past(itself a compact abstraction of expirience) and compared with its prior pattern.

Learning abstract patterns is actually building simulacra structures:
When we learn to recognize something as X, we have a pattern X that is compared with our experience, the 'abstract model of proper/normal/average X'
is fitted into the experience and its unique qualities are disregarded(every bunny is in fact unique).
The main problem  we can observe here, is that pattern recognition power shields us from the unique qualities of the world, making sense quick&easy at expense of fine analysis, allowing us to reduce heavy brain activity and concentrate on the "big picture":

Big Picture is a simulacra that forces the brain to deprioritize detail in favor of most important patterns and most general abstractions:
Example:
100 bunnies and 1 Snake: become Bunny x100  and Snake x1:
instead of each bunny and the lone snake being 
assigned  a unique model and equal recognition(which is counterproductive as snake is more important in survival as a source of threat) . 
The pattern recognition apparatus quickly prioritizes the top threat and we instinctively allocate more cognitive resources to the primary object of the scene(a top threat in this case being killed by a snake found in the "big picture"),

The sense of urgency, stress and reflexive thinking is actually our pattern recognition failing to classify threats and priorities:
Videogames, crowds,suspense movies,warfare, puzzles,sports train the brain to solve "find most important pattern in big picture" over and over again, reinforcing the supremacy of fast pattern recognition over anything else: .
We can't find all the "abstract snakes" and stress results from failure to spin down,
always in a torrent of new data/news/events which we pick for "top threats". 
This state of mind is deforming our sense of reality, creating twitch-like response to perfectly normal situations as pattern-recognition goes into overdrive:
creating mental disorders(seeing patterns that don't actually exists), disregarding all "big pictures" as lost/failed events(depression, apathy) and avoiding seeing the "big picture"(escapism, avoidant personality disorder).

Deprioritizing simulacra:
The solution for break the pattern recognition engine iron grip on reality is actually simple: introspection, analysis and re-evalution of our abstract models(breaking the power of fear by reframing the "snake pattern" as delusion of the mind).
Some meditation techniques that deal with focusing on objects can aid the process(knowing the fear, as well as forcing oneself to face the fears) as well as simple mental discipline to prepare the mind for scanning the "big picture":
Denying the reflexive response("this isn't going to be a real threat") and questioning the causes of our response(why I am responding to X as if it was Y?).
