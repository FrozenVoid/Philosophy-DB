The Corrupted Blood incident 
(also known as the World of Warcraft pandemic[1][2]
) took place between September 13 and 
October 8, 2005, in World of Warcraft,
a massively multiplayer online role-playing game
(MMORPG) developed by Blizzard Entertainment. 
When participating in a boss battle at the 
end of a raid, player characters would become
infected with a debuff that was transmitted
between characters in close proximity. 
While developers intended to keep the effects of
the debuff in the boss's game region, 
a programming oversight soon led to an in-game
pandemic throughout the
fictional world of Azeroth.
