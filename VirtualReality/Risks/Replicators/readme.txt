A replicator is a piece of virtual content
that has means or properties allowing
it to replicate itself or it parts, without control of
simulation parameters:
Usually the static limits or their "count" definition
is bypassed, but dumb replicators can be 
a threat when their properties are 
using disproportional resources without 
reaching their quota/limit.

Classes of replicators:
A.Space blocker: a replicator that
alters its own size,area or space occupied 
without changing its quantity(usually),
e.g. space-filling "infinite water source",
or a primitive fungus growing in all direction.
see C. for more advanced forms.

B.Bunny replicator: a mobile replicator that
uses scripting or static event logic to spawn
copies of itself, usually attaches or insert own 
payload generator to other object:
the "spawn point" that releases more bunny replicators.
Limits on amount of total objects usually
stop such replicators, but finding and disabling
all spawn points/generators would be more 
complicated as varieties of such replicators
would use disguise and mimicry to appear benign
parts of a the world.

C.Trigger-based replicator:
a replicator that activates through a trigger
 condition that usually doesn't fire 
 but doesn't appear replicating due some
 hidden state(e.g. invisibility or disguised forms)
example: a tree that spawn mosquitos, that
appear invisible until they leave the tree area
and then change their properties to avoid
being traced back to the replicator.

D.Cloner: a replicator that clones
existing objects, usually adding a viral
payload. This types of replicators
 use disguise to evade detection and 
avoid rapid generation of own copies.
A typical "Cloner" would be a script that
steals properties of object that left
an area to create a copy of it.

E.Property insertion:
An object that abuses property fields and
inserts content into existing objects that
gradually slow-down the simulation.
The payload of such object would be spreading
some spam, non-sense data or offensive content,
replicated into other objects. A variation would 
alter writeable object parameters or 
properties to spread content externally:
e.g. visual spam.
