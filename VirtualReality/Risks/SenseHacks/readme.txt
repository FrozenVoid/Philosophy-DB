 sense hacks is category of exploits of 
 virtual perception: the sensing person receives
 some unexpected "data" simulating a sense perception
 that could have adverse effects.
 
 Examples:
 Smell: simulated smell could be toxic molecule
 constructed on-the fly as combination that 
 is not tested or interaction between several
 molecules that creates toxic or extremely 
 dangerous compounds. Unexpected psychological 
 effects of strong smells and their combination
 could create a toxic VR expirience.
 
 
 Sight: A pattern of colors/frames/picture could\
 be engineered to overload the brain of
 viewer, similar to epileptic triggers, though
 the more sinister approach would allow
 companies to insert subliminal, tailor-made
 visual suggestions that would serve as 
 neuro-adverts combined with binaural entrainment
  sounds.
  
 Sound: binaural/monaural/isotonic patterns 
 could be exploited to harm or overload specific
 circuits in the brain, change moods or alter
 perception. These would be especially potent
  as invisible, non-perceptible sound scould be
  inserted in any context or be dynamically
  generated from multiple sources(as combination
  or interference pattern). Induced voice
  perception and tinnitus could create lasting
  psychological harm.
  
  
 Touch:exploits could create virtual traps or
 unpleasant attachment forms that simulate
 parasites or agressive animals that attack
 the person via touch perception.
 More subtle forms could create itching or
  imperceptible malaise through vibration
  and control of temperature.
  
Orientation/Avatar illusions: 
  Illusion of changing/moving skin,
 lack of space orientation and alteration
 of normal avatar feedback can induce 
 fight or flight reactions, along with extreme
 stress as person tries to escape hostile
 environment.
