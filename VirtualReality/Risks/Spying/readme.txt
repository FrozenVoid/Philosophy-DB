Virtual objects could be used as 
recording or transmitting equipment in VR,
serving as hidden channel to monitor people
or events. The spying objects will usually be disguised
or hidden from the simulation.

Types:
A.Recorder: the object is a static
or trigger-based recording script that stores
data in itself or hidden objects, which is later
copied or sent to the source.See C. for advanced forms.

B.Transmitter: A camera or recorder that
create a real-time channel to spy on a 
simulation. The channel and location of transmitter
are usually well-hidden  or out-of-reach
(e.g. attached to avatar/mobile object/etc).
Additional network traffic would likely be 
encrypted and disguised to evade analysis,
as trivial transmission will be easily found
by automated tools.
Advanced versions would use side-channels
to transmit data that will appear benign,
e.g. subtle alteration of color/shape/vibration
that is transmitted and decoded by other objects.

C.Event recorder: a recorder object that has advanced
 behaviour that record events and conditions
only when specific triggers are met,
Transmission and replication of recorded data
is usually done by separate scripts that
work in tandem, avoiding detection of data flow.

D.External modeling: 
a set of programs/scripts that replicate 
simulation content to model future behaviour
of its state: That idea of external modeling
is analysis of "general environment" to determine
internal content and atmosphere of unreachable
 simulation, usually using data scraping
 and public information to reconstruct event flow.
 
E.Attached device: A seemingly benign
object collects information for its source,
that in combination with other monitoting
allows to spy on a simulation: 
e.g. heart rate monitor that transmits or
shows its stats to other objects/scripts
that allow the source program to reconstruct
person behaviour.

F.In-transit hijack: a script/object
 that steals data of nearby avatars/objects/scripts
usually outside the simulation scope or
operate partially inside simulation as access point
to some other service(e.g. virtual market).
The idea of such object is that its operation
is externally-guided and inauditable from within
a simulation, only allowing interface('transit point')
that is linked to source(actually a spy) and 
triggered manually by its victims.
