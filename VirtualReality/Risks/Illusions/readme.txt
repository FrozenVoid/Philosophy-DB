A malicious simulation or script-object
within one, can create illusory states that
compel its victims to perform some action
or divulge sensitive information.
Types:
A.Avatar replica: A person identity could be
stolen and replicated as virtual avatar that
could be used by malicious party to convince
a person to do arbitrary actions due
interactions with replica avatar(s) optimized
by AI to exploit psychology of victim.

B.Illusory problem: a program can simulate
illness, perceptual corruption or some
mental confusion to reduce confidence in
reality which would be exploited to some
purpose. The problem-reaction-solution sequence
is the typical outcome of reflexive response,
where person tries to correct an illusory problem
stepping into a trap or compromising some data.


C.Illusory authority: within a simulation,
verification of transmission and reception
can be altered in visual or non-visual forms
that appear as replica of some actual 
authority source(e.g. a bank or organization)
allow programs to steal,alter or modify 
the person's attached properties that depend
on such authority.

D.Overlays: a program can alter the sense input
of a person to compel any action in disadvantage
of viewer, usually exploiting lack of secondary
verification or confirmation.
e.g. clicking OK instead of Cancel, as 
OK and Cancel buttons places are disguised
by an overlay that swaps their positions.

E.Avatar hijacking: a person avatar is
hijacked as illusory state creates a sequence
of events that don't correspond to reality:
e.g. avatar moving from A to B, but actually
staying in-place and moving its arms to
open an invisible control panel.
