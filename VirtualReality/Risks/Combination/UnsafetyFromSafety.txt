A general risk category that allow
 to create unsafe/harmful content from
 safe content is "Combination sequence".
 In virtual world the content pieces could
 only be verified to be safe in isolation,
 as combinatorial explosion prevents testing
 of each combination of elements.
This allow to construct "Combination payloads"
of specific content pieces as sequences that
generates "harmful content" as defined by
system rules. The landscape of such combinations
is vast, but variety of such content can be classified
as following:
1.Partial generation: objects generate a seemingly
benign part of content, which combined in time
create a "musical" sequence that has effects outside
of its parts.
2.Modified content: A piece of benign content
is modified in sequence that results in harmful
content, with each modification step performed
by separate object or event.
3.Misperception: objects disguse content or
other objects, but appear benign in isolation.
An activated sequence would reveal the content or
pattern of events.
